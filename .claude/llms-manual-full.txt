# Codecks Manual

Fundamentals
===================


Welcome to Codecks! This document will provide you with everything you need to know to get started.

<Aside>

Codecks was born from over a decade of game development experience. During that time, we tested many tools—Jira, Trello, Hansoft, to name a few—but none of them fully met our needs. So, we built Codecks to be the right tool for game developers. Here's what sets Codecks apart:

**Playful**
Too often, teams are forced to use clunky, slow tools that no one wants to engage with. This leads to poor communication, unmanageable scope, and missed deadlines. We wanted to create a tool that feels as playful and meticulously crafted as the UI in our games. When the entire team—from game designers to programmers and artists—embraces the tool, it provides the clarity and high-level perspective needed to stay on track. For us, playfulness isn’t a bonus; it’s essential to getting your whole team wanting to use the tool.

**Laser-Focused on Game Dev**
Most project management tools try to cater to everyone, resulting in a bloated, overcomplicated mess. From day one, we focused on the specific needs of game developers. This allows us to make smarter decisions about what features to include or leave out. Since we use Codecks ourselves for professional game development, we’ve streamlined it to offer only the features you need—nothing more, nothing less. All the power, without the unnecessary complexity.

**Unique Integrations**
Our game dev focus also enables us to offer unique integrations you won’t find elsewhere. We believe community management is a superpower for modern game studios, so we’ve integrated Discord community management, open roadmaps, and in-game reporting directly into the project management workflow. Plus, we offer built-in integrations with Unity and Unreal Engine, among many other features.

</Aside>

## Cards

### States

States
Codecks uses a trading card game metaphor. Every task, [document](/doc-cards/), or bug is represented as a card. Cards have built-in properties to help you manage them, with the most important being [effort](/effort/) and [priority](/priority/). Each card also follows a built-in workflow and can exist in the following states:

- _Unassigned_: The card has no [owner](/owner/) yet.
- _Assigned_: The card is assigned to an owner.
- _Started_: The card is actively being worked on.
- _Blocked_: The card is stuck and cannot proceed until an issue is resolved.
- _Review_: The card is completed but requires feedback or insights from the team.
- _Done_: The task associated with the card is finished.

### Conversations

The Blocked and Review states are special because they trigger [conversation](/conversations/). We believe communication is one of the biggest challenges for large teams. When you set a card to Blocked or Review, you can pull other team members into a conversation thread specific to that card. Team members receive real-time notifications requesting their input. Of course, you can also start conversations outside of these states whenever needed.

<Aside>

What makes these conversations in Codecks special is that:

- Conversations have a start and end point, instead of being a endless stream. Conversations should always have a specific question that you want to solve. Once that goal is reached the conversation is closed and Codecks can rest calmly until the next conversation needs to be addressed.
- Codecks will remind you of ongoing converations that are not resolved. We call stale conversations 'snoozing'.
- Conversations always have a specific people involved. You can dynamically add team members at any point if you need additional input.
- Team members can remove themselves from a conversation to signal that they have no more input on the subject.

This makes conversations especially powerful in Codecks. You can think of it as a built-in no-question-unanswered guarantee. No more important conversations that are forgotten in a random DM convo.

</Aside>

Usually a card goes through these states:
Start card ➡️ Block card (if you run into issues that require other team members) ➡️ Review card ➡️ Set to done

One thing that makes Codecks different is that it does not use the usual Kanban representation, but allows you to [slice and dice](/sorting/) information as needed. You can resort and filter any deck or milestone as it makes sense for you.

To keep your projects clean, Codecks automatically archives cards that have been in the Done state for a while. You can customize how long this takes in the organization settings. Archiving simply hides the card from the default view to reduce clutter. However, all archived cards are just a click away, so you can easily review past work, such as everything completed in a milestone.

## Decks

As with any project you will be dealing with a lot of cards over time. Let's briefly check how to manage these in Codecks:

After creating several cards, the next step is to organize them. In Codecks, cards are stacked into [decks](/decks/). Each card can belong to exactly one deck. You’ll find your collection of decks in the Decks tab, which serves as a sort of backlog—a collection of tasks, ideas, and bugs that you may want to tackle next week, next month, next year, or possibly never. It’s where everything lives, from large, ambitious ideas to concrete tasks that are ready to be worked on. These decks can scale to hold thousands of cards.

A smart way to organize your decks is by work department (e.g., coding, game design, art) or asset type (e.g., enemies, weapons, levels), or a combination of both. [Spaces](/projects/) within projects can be used to separate different deck types and help with navigation. You can also add descriptions to each deck to make it easier for your team to identify where specific cards belong. Additionally, you can set a default inbox deck for yourself, so cards are automatically created in the appropriate deck (e.g., coding or art).

![Decks with Spaces](./images/projects/spaces.png)

## Milestones and Runs

Managing thousands of cards can get overwhelming, so it's helpful to break them down into work-sized chunks by assigning them to [milestones](/milestones/). Milestones are collections of cards associated with specific dates, such as release deadlines or contractual obligations. You can assign any card from your decks to a milestone. Additionally, you can define Runs, which are recurring work cycles (weekly, biweekly, or monthly), often referred to as "Sprints" in other tools. A card can be part of both a milestone and a run, allowing you to manage long-term deliverables while tracking ongoing work cycles simultaneously.

![Timeline](./images/milestones/timeline.png)

Once you start using milestones and runs, your backlog will be filtered down to a smaller, focused selection of cards that you're committed to. This creates a solid foundation for getting work done. Instead of scanning through all your decks, you can simply focus on the cards in the milestone or upcoming run, making it easier to decide what to work on next.

## Hand

If a milestone or run is still far off, it might contain dozens of cards. To manage this, you can further break down your workload by using your hand. The hand is a unique concept in Codecks and represents the cards you plan to tackle next. Just like in real life, everyone in Codecks has their own hand.

The Hand tab is also your central dashboard in Codecks. It lets you view your hand (the tasks you’re focusing on next), ongoing conversations (including reviews and blocked cards requiring your input), bookmarks, due cards, hands of other team members, and even a personalized quick view of your current milestone or run.

![Quick Hand View](./images/hand/CardHand.png)

<Aside>

In conclusion, you can think of the lifecycle of a card following increasing levels of commitment:

1. Create a new card and assign it to a deck (target: sometime in the future).
2. Assign the card to a milestone (target: next few months).
3. Assign the card to a run (target: next couple of weeks).
4. Add the card to your hand (target: next few days).
5. Use the built-in workflow to work on the card (target: next few hours).

</Aside>

As you work on projects, the order of these steps might change, and that’s completely fine. For example, while working on a run, you may discover a new aspect of a feature and decide to add a card directly to the milestone (though you’ll still need to assign it to a deck). Or, if you're working on a smaller project, you might prefer to move cards straight from the Decks tab into your hand and work through them. You can even choose to disable the Milestones and Runs feature entirely if it feels unnecessary for your workflow.

Codecks is flexible enough to adapt to your project and team size, allowing you to tailor the workflow as needed.

## Community

When creating a cool project, you want to ensure it reaches as many people as possible. That’s where the second major component of Codecks comes in: community management. Codecks offers several unique ways to engage with your community directly from the platform:

- Our unique [discord](/discord/) integration allows you to collect bug reports straight from your discord community
- With [open decks](/open-decks/) you can publish and maintain a public roadmap, updated directly from Codecks
- Our user reporting enables you to collect bugs and feedback directly from your game using Unity, Unreal or our [API](/api/)

This is a great example of how we focus on integrations that other companies might overlook.

![Example Leaderboard as shown in Discord](<./images/discord/6 Leaderboards.png>)

<Adventure>
  You stand in the entrance hall of the Mountain of the Card Witch. You have come to steal her
  treasure. In front of you, a gate shimmers with magic. The gate is being guarded by a portly man,
  his bushy beard streaked white. “Ah, another visitor. Come to see the Halls of the Card Witch? I
  need to calibrate the gate before you can step through.” You could [wait for the guard](/history/)
  to calibrate whatever needs calibrating, before stepping through the gate. But you could also
  ignore the man’s pleas and [step through the gate now](/conversations/).
</Adventure>

## Setting up your first project

Here’s a suggested way to organize your first game project in Codecks:

1. Under your project, create a space called 'Tasks' with decks representing different work areas (e.g., coding, animation, modeling, texturing, etc.).
2. Create another space called 'GDD' (Game Design Documents) with decks representing assets in your game (e.g., enemies, levels, weapons).

This structure unlocks two powerful tools in Codecks: **Hero Cards** and **Journeys**.

- **Hero Cards** are cards that contain other sub-cards, which are just as functional as any other card. They can have owners, effort, priority, milestones, and tags](/tags/).
- **Journeys** are predefined templates for automatically creating these sub-cards, acting as asset pipelines.

Using Hero Cards and Journeys offers several advantages:

- You get a quick overview of related tasks for any asset. For example, which textures still need to be created? What coding tasks are linked? How many bugs are known for this asset?
- It eliminates repetitive busywork by automating the creation of commonly used cards.
- It helps codify best practices, ensuring you don’t overlook important tasks.

This is just a brief overview of what Codecks offers. To speed up your workflow further, be sure to explore quick settings and make use of [shortcuts](/shortcuts/). If you need to organize cards in more detail, check out tags and dependencies. Remember, not every card in Codecks has to represent a task—it can also be used to create complex text documents, linked together like a wiki.

Enjoy your Codecks journey!

# Workflow and Card States

At the heart of Codecks is a unique workflow and conversation model. If you want to make sure to understand how magical Codecks can feel, then this is the part to pay attention to. It can turn your team work into a finely tuned steampunk machinery of joyful efficiency (_you can probably tell, we're really excited about this part_).

Regular Codecks cards come with workflow states already built-in. Card can be in the following states:

- Unassigned
- Assigned
- Started
- Blocked
- In-Review
- Done

By default all cards are in Unassigned state. All other states are optional and may or may not be used depending on your own preference. We recommend using all of them to appreciate the full power of Codecks.

The only cards not using this workflow are [Hero Cards](/hero-cards/) and [Doc Cards](/doc-cards/).

<Aside>
The color palette for workflow states can be changed in the user profile settings to improve accessibility for color-blind users:

![Palette section](./images/workflow/color-palettes.png)

</Aside>

## Unassigned and Assigned card

![Unassigned card](<./images/workflow/1 Unassigned big.png>)

These are the defaults states for cards with (assigned) and without (unassigned) owners.

![Assigned card](<./images/workflow/2 Assigned big.png>)

<Aside>
Cards can represent whatever you put on them. Not all cards will contain actionable tasks and it is completely fine for cards to always stay in this state if applying a work state to them makes no sense.

Examples for cards where it might make no sense to assign work states are technical or organizational look-up documents, overarching game design documents and similar cards.

</Aside>

## Started cards

![Started card](<./images/workflow/3 Started big.png>)

Cards that represent tasks and that you are working on should be put into the _started_ state by pressing the play button on top of the opened card. As a quick **shortcut** you may also press the `spacebar` while mouse hovering over the (mini) card.

Be aware that cards that are started must have an owner. If you start a card that currently has no owner, the card will be automatically assigned to yourself before being set to _started_.

<Aside>
There are some extra rules when you've activated [real-time tracking](/time-tracking/):

Once a card is started, the timer starts running for that card. This means that any previously started card will be stopped automatically.

If you start a card that belongs to a different owner, the card will first be assigned to yourself.

</Aside>

Started cards are shown in blue color and signal your teammates that you're actively pursuing the work that this card represents.

## Blocked Cards

![Blocked card with conversation](<./images/workflow/4 Blocked big.png>)

Alas, as in life not everything in game dev or project management always runs smoothly. While you are working on the card, you may run into a roadblock in the form of missing information, missing assets or technical issues. In this case you may set the card to _blocked_ by clicking the exclamation point icon on top of the opened card.

This opens a special conversation thread. Use it to draw team mates into a conversation and to describe the issue that you're currently facing. Use the portrait icons or typing `@` to add as many team members as you need to resolve the situation. Whereas cards can only be assigned to one person at most, there is no limit to how many of your team mates can be involved in discussions.

If you're working solo or you are blocked by outside influences you can still set the card to blocked even without drawing in additional team members. This will help signal to yourself or to other team members why you currently can't proceed on a certain task.

Send the message by pressing `ctrl/cmd + enter` or click the send button and your mentioned team mates will receive a notification alert informing them that you are stuck and need help. Blocked cards are shown in red color.

As your team members reply to the block conversation and give you valuable information, you get notifications for each reply. Depending on the information you may want to draw in additional people by mentioning them in your comment. Team members that can't help may opt out of the conversation (see the [conversations document](/conversations/) for more info).

Once the underlying issue is resolved, you can unblock the card by clicking on the _unblock this card_ button below the block conversation. This will put the card back into its previous state. The special block conversation will be closed doing this.

If you are running on [real-time tracking](/time-tracking/) the time that the card spends in blocked state is not counted towards the work time of the card.

## In-Review Cards

![Review card with conversation](<./images/workflow/5 In-review big.png>)

Let's assume everything now goes swimmingly and you're able to finish the work on the card. If you are looking for the opinion or approval of other team members, you can put the card into _review_ state by clicking the _question mark_ icon above the opened card.

Doing this opens a special review conversation. As with block conversations or regular conversations you may select as many team mates as you want or need. All mentioned team members get a notification and can support you with the required feedback.

As with block conversation it is not required to draw in any person at all and you can set the review state even if you're the only participant. In-review cards are shown in turquoise color.

Once you've gained enough feedback you may end the review state by clicking the 'close this review' button. After doing that the card will ask you if you want to set the card to done as well.

<Aside>
Based on the review feedback you may have learned that there is more work to do. If the amount of additional work is substantial we recommend to end the review state and set the card back to _assigned_ or _started_. This signals clearly that you're not looking for more feedback as you are working on the extension. Once you are done with the new work you may open a fresh review state for new feedback.

For smaller feedback tasks it is often easiest to just keep the card in review state and handle the feedback right away, informing your team mates about any additional updates in the existing thread.

</Aside>

## Done Cards and Archived Cards

![Done Card](<./images/workflow/6 Done big.png>)

Done cards are shown in green color and represent cards that don't have any actionable tasks left to do. You may reach this card state after going through the whole _started_-_blocked_-_review_ workflow or by simply setting a card directly to done. How many or few of the workflow steps you use is up to you and your team. We recommend using the full workflow for maximum magic of course.🧙‍♂️

Cards which are done feel great but might clutter up your Decks, Runs and Milestones as time passes. Codecks auto archives done cards after a set amount of time. You can customize that time limit in the organization settings (reachable via the joystick button in the top left).

![Archived Card](<./images/workflow/7 Archived big.png>)

Archived cards look like regular cards with an additional icon on the card. By default they are hidden from the deck view or search results but can be retrieved by using the _include archived_ button in the top-right area of any search popup box. As a shortcut, Decks, Runs and Milestone views also feature a _include archive_ button directly next to the search input field.

You can also skip the auto-archival step and manually archive cards by clicking the _archive_ button in the bottom right area of opened cards. Cards that were archived but not done yet, are shown in a dark gray color to signal that they have become obsolete.

Once a card has been archived you may choose to delete it by using the _remove_ button again in the bottom right area of the opened archived card. It is a good idea to keep around most archived cards to look up information at a later point. Deleted cards can't be searched or found again after deletion.

You can use the bulk action bar to archive multiple cards.

<Adventure>
  You arrive at what must be the bustling heart of the dungeon! Dozens of goblins are hurrying past
  you. They carry boxes from one end of the hall to the other and argue loudly among themselves.
  Enormous machines all around you hum with foul magic. Nobody pays you any mind. It’s rush hour!
  Several large doors lead out of this place. Do you [enter the door with the hourglass
  symbol](/time-tracking/)? Or, maybe, you want to [explore the most beautiful door](/projects/),
  golden and inlaid with ornaments. There is also, of course, the busiest door of them all, [a path
  into what looks like a factory](/dependencies/).
</Adventure>

## Snoozing Cards

![Snoozing Card](<./images/workflow/8 Snoozing big.png>)

Once a card was started and hasn't been touched in a long time, it will enter a snoozing state. This is basically the app asking: _"Hey haven't heard from you in a long time, is everything okay?"_. You can hit the snoozing icon at the top of the opened card to continue. Changing a property or the card text will unsnooze the card as well.

This state should help you and your team identifying stale tasks. You can configure the time it takes for an untouched started card to snooze via the organization settings.

<Aside>

[Real-time tracking](/time-tracking/) changes the snoozing functionality slightly. The card will automatically snooze if you exceeded the maximum tracking time. The duration can be configured in the time tracking section in your organization settings.

If you open up Codecks in the morning and noticed that you forgot to turn off tracking, you can head to the card's history and edit the tracked time entry there. You should be able to reconstruct the proper tracked time by looking at when you started the tracking and when you approximately left work.

</Aside>



# Managing conversations

At the core of each team is strong communication. Conversations and [workflow](/workflow/) are two key components of Codecks.

![Card with sample conversation](./images/conversations/intro.png)

## Creating a new conversation

All conversations live inside of Cards. Click on the conversations button on any opened Card to see all conversations tied to that Card. Enter text in the comment text area and click 'send' or `ctrl/cmd + enter` to open a new thread or to reply to an existing thread.

Mention [team members](/users/) to draw them into the conversation. You can do this by typing `@` and selecting their name from the popup list or by clicking on their portrait image. Adding teammates to the conversation will notify them that you're looking for their input. You can see who is part of a conversation by looking at the user icons on top of each conversation.

All conversations in Codecks are open. You can read all ongoing or past conversations on any Card that you have access to. If you comment on a conversation that you were not yet part of, you will automatically be added to the participants list and be notified on further replies.

## No-loose ends

Ever had to deal with tasks that were not done because they were forgotten? Tasks that got lost in the gaps of the proverbial project management cushions, to be found again too late and close to a deadline? Codecks features a no-loose ends paradigm 🚀 , which guides many of our design decisions, but here are a couple of key rules:

- **Closable Conversations** Conversations in Codecks have a clear start and end point. As long as a conversation is not closed by a team member, the topic will be regarded as unresolved and all the active participants will receive reminders to push them towards coming to a conclusion.

<Aside>
  Yes, these reminders are _slightly annoying by design_. In our experience dragging out decisions
  and talking points over many days is rarely a good idea. Codecks is designed to nudge you towards
  coming to conclusions (say no to zombie threads that go nowhere).
</Aside>

- **Threaded Conversations** You may have multiple conversations running at the same time on a Card. This allows addressing different topics with different participants on the same Card. Less participants often also helps with coming to a conclusion quicker.

- **Beast Conversations** If a conversation hasn't made progress for a couple of days, we highlight the stalling conversation by using our notorious beast icon on the conversation. So make sure to fight those beasts by unclogging conversations and moving them forward. Just remember: beasts = delay.

- **Smart Notifications** Notifications are automatically dismissed when you inspect them - no need to manually click dismiss buttons. Think of them as an impromptu todo list that stays relevant to what needs your attention right now.

<Adventure>
  You land in a small room. A dozen or so goblins are milling around a grimy table. They talk loudly
  and munch stale bread. Some of them sip from cups containing a vile brown liquid giving off a
  pungent smell. Behind them, an important looking door leads further into the dugeon. When you
  arrive, all of their eyes are on you. Some of them slowly reach for tiny daggers. What now? If you
  had a sword, you could surely [fight through them](/workflow/). Unarmed, you’re not sure if you
  can them on, but you certainly can try to [knock out the goblins](/sorting/) . Of course, you
  could always just [talk to the monsters](/hand/) and ask them show you around.
</Adventure>

## Snoozing conversations

![Snoozing conversation picker](./images/conversations/snooze-convo.png)

Sometimes you're part of a conversation but can't take action right now - maybe you're waiting on someone else's reply or some other information. To keep your conversation list focused on what actually needs your attention, you can snooze conversations to temporarily move them out of your inbox.

When you snooze a conversation, you can set it to return after a configurable amount of time. Don't worry about missing important updates: snoozed conversations are automatically awakened if somebody else leaves a comment that might make the conversation actionable again.

To snooze a conversation look for the button with the snoozing icon below the comment field. It'll show you a couple of options. You can also trigger the button by hitting `v`. The button needs to be in view for this to work as there might be multiple ongoing conversations on a single Card.

This helps keep your conversation tab focused on discussions that require your immediate attention, rather than being cluttered with conversations you're waiting on others to advance.

![5 snoozing vonversations hidden behind a button](./images/conversations/snoozing-convos-button.png)

## Reactions

Sometimes a full comment isn't necessary, but you want to quickly acknowledge a message, show appreciation, or give simple feedback. Emoji reactions let you do just that directly on individual comments.

**To add a reaction:**

1. **Hover your mouse** over the comment you want to react to.
2. An emoji selection bar will appear.
3. Click on one of your **recently used emojis** for a quick reaction, or click the **add reaction button** to open the full emoji picker and find the perfect one.

A key benefit is that **you don't need to be part of the conversation thread to add a reaction**. This avoids the awkwardness of joining a thread just to drop a quick "👍" or "✅" and then immediately leaving. Whether you opted out previously or are just browsing a conversation you weren't part of, you can add a reaction without affecting your participation status.

Reactions provide a lightweight way to enhance communication, making interactions more seamless and adding a touch of personality to your team's discussions on Codecks.

## Opting-out

Unless you're the owner of a Card, you can remove yourself from a conversation, if you don't have anything to add and don't want to receive further notification. To remove yourself from a conversation click on your own portrait icon on top of the thread. Your portrait icon will become grayed out to signal that you were part of the conversation but opted out from further updates. Codecks will also add a note to let the other participants know.

You may return to the conversation by clicking on your portrait icon again. Other team members might also add you back into the conversation by mentioning you again.

<Aside>

### Slash Commands

![Slash Commands on a blocked Card](./images/conversations/slash-commands.png)

When writing a comment, there exist a few conversation-specific slash commands:

- `/close`: Close conversation
- `/done`: Close conversation and mark Card as done
- `/optout`: Opt out of conversation

Should the input contain other text, it will be posted as comment. Otherwise the command will be executed without adding a comment.

</Aside>

## Conversation View

If you want to get an overview of all conversations that you're part of or that are currently happening in your project(s), open the 'conversations tab' in your [hand](/hand/) dashboard. This will show you all Cards conversations that you're involved in:

- Blocked Cards
- Cards in review
- Cards with open comment threads

The conversation tab focuses on discussions that need your attention. Snoozed conversations are hidden from this view unless they're awakened by new activity. You can also inspect any conversation that is going on without your involvement by clicking the 'Show All' button to the right. Conversation updates also show up in the activity stream.

<question>
  Should I mention anything about how the snoozing feature works in terms of UI/UX - like how users
  actually snooze a conversation? The changes mention it exists but don't describe the interaction.
</question>

<question>
  Are there any visual indicators or UI elements for beast conversations beyond the beast icon that
  should be mentioned?
</question>



The Hand tab is your central dashboard showing your personal work queue, ongoing conversations that require your attention and your bookmarks.

<Aside>

This video will give you a good introduction of how to use the Hand and its associated features:

</Aside>

# Card Hand

In Codecks Hands are personal todo lists. They can contain any of your owned Cards, independent of project, milestone or priority. You can freely drag and drop Cards to sort them in any order that you want. Like in a Card game you can think of them as your short list of Cards that are relevant right now and will be played next.

<Aside>
  You will generally want to tackle Cards in the order of their priority in a Run or in a deck, but
  - as we all know - priority is not always the driving factor for working on tasks. You might work
  on multiple related Cards that you want to handle in one go, even though not all of them might
  have the highest priority right now. Or you're at the end of the work day and you want to work on
  something short before finishing the day. Your Hand gives you quick access to the set of Cards
  that you want to work on next - whatever those are.
</Aside>

As a users's Hand can only contain Cards owned by that user, a Card can only be in one Hand at a time. Starting progress on any of your Cards will automatically move it to the front of your Hand. Removing the owner from a Card, will also remove it from their Hand.

In front of your Hand, you'll find the **done pile** which contains all your recently done Cards. As you set Cards to done, they'll be automatically moved out of your Hand into the done pile. The top of the done pile will feature the most recently done Card, but clicking on it allows you to inspect all the Cards of the pile. You may clear your done pile as you like (we recommend daily or weekly).

Your Hand has a limit of how many Cards it can contain. The minimum number is seven Cards, which represent your **top Cards**. Cards that have been added to any Hand are designated with a small Hand icon. If a Card is in one of their owner's seven top slots, the icon will also feature a small number specifying the exact spot. Beyond those seven top Cards, your Hand may also contain up to 21 additional Cards (the exact setting can be customized in your organization settings). The default setting is set to 14 (7 top Cards and 7 additional slots).

## Hand Management

![Quick Hand View](./images/hand/CardHand.png)

On any opened Card you can click the Hand icon at the top to open the **Quick Hand** view. This allows you to quickly inspect the Hand of the current owner of the Card and drop the Card into any of the slots. You may even re-arrange the order of other Cards in the Hand. You can discard Cards from the Hand by clicking the disCard action that appears when hovering over a Card or by dragging the Card into the lower "Cards not in Hand" section.

When exiting the quick view by clicking outside the panel or pressing `ESC` you will be put back right at your previous location so that you never lose context.

Selecting multiple Cards and clicking the _Hand_ bulk action will open the _quick Hand view_ with all the selected Cards being added to the view. This allows you slot in multiple Cards at once. You can even select Cards that are owned by multiple people and the quick Hand view will feature a user tab for quickly switching between the different relevant Hands. If you hold down the `CTRL/CMD` key before clicking the Hand bulk action the quick view will be skipped and all Cards will instead be directly appended to their owner's Hand. If all the selected Cards are already in a Hand, the action will instead discard them from all their Hands without opening the quick view.

When creating a new Card you can choose to add it to the owner's Hand right away by toggling the Hand icon on top the Card-creation dialogue. The Card will be appended to the owner's Hand. This action won't be available if they don't have any open Hand slots available anymore.

<Aside>
How and when exactly to do Card Hand assignments is up to your own team culture.

- For teams that are using the full feature set of Codecks, your Hand will represent what you're _doing next_, whereas Cards in [Runs](/runs/) represent what you're _doing in one or several weeks_, and other Cards in your decks represent what you'll be _doing at some undefined point in the future, possibly never_. In this case your team might choose to plan Runs together but then handle the Hand assignments individually. Everybody picks new Cards for their Hand organically as they work through the Run.
- You might be using a Kanban approach (talking about the process methodology here) where Cards are continuously picked from the decks directly without using any Runs. You might still be using milestones to mark important release dates but use the Hands to communicate short-term goals.
- The Hand is also great for freelancers that might not be deeply integrated into the process model of the rest of your team. It allows you to micromanage their work queue by picking and arranging Cards directly in their Hands. This allows them to log into Codecks and already see their sorted assignment list right away without having to dig into the decks or Timeline view or necessarily learning about the overall project structure.
- On an individual level you might choose to pick new Cards for your Hand once per week. Or you may clear out your Hand and done pile at the start of each day and then restock it with what you have planned for the day. Seeing the done pile fill up through-out the day can be super motivating!

</Aside>

## Your Conversations

![Click on this tab to see all your Codecks conversations](./images/hand/YourConversations.png)

This section gives you quick access to all the ongoing conversations (reviews, blocks and comments) that you're involved in. Your ongoing conversations will appear in this section until the conversation has been closed or you opted out of the conversation.

By toggling the "Show all" button on the right side you can see all the ongoing conversations in the project, including those that you're not currently part of.

<Adventure>

You are lucky. These goblins were just finishing their shift. They take you to their favorite spot, the Mountain’s Tavern. It’s loud, and warm, and smells of spices. Goblins come and go to drink and party. There are some gnarly looking goblins here, a ragtag band with wild haircuts. Do you have what it takes to [join them at the cool goblin’s table](/tags/)? Or do you want to play it safe and [follow the regular goblins out of the tavern](/workflow/), see where that could take you.

</Adventure>

## Your Runs

![Preview of Run section](./images/hand/Run.png)

This section will show all Cards owned by you in all your current [Runs](/run/). It will show all Runs that you have access to. This depends on whether there's an overlap with the projects you have access to and the projects that are used in the Run Configuration.

The Runs are ordered as follows:

- If you own no cards, in a Run, the Run will be shown in the bottom group
- Both groups are ordered by the end date of a Run, the closer the end, the higher up it will be

For each Run, Cards will be grouped by Zone as defined by the Run's [manual order](/sorting/#manual-order-and-zones).

You can use drag and drop to move Cards within the section or to your Hand above.

Clicking on the Run's name will open the full Run view in the Timeline.

## Pinned Milestone

![Preview of Pinned Milestone section](./images/hand/PinnedMs.png)

You can pin any [Milestone](/milestones/) by opening it and looking for the pin icon 📌. Once pinned, this Milestone will show up in your Hand under the `Pinned Milestone` section. This section will show all your owned Cards of this Milestone. The Cards will be grouped according to the Milestone's [zones](/sorting/#manual-order-and-zones). You can use drag and drop to move Cards within the section or to your Hand above.

Use the `See full Milestone` button at the top right to manage both Zones and see all the Cards of the Milestone.

## Team Hands

Beyond the quick Hand view you can also inspect the Hands of other team members directly from the Hand tab in the **Team Hands** section. Click _manage_ to set which team member's Hand you want to see and the order in which they should appear. This gives you a quick overview of what other team members are working on right now and planning to do next. You may even change the Card order of Cards inside of your team member's Hand by simply drag and dropping Cards. Make sure to establish with your team how and when this is appropriate to do.

![Click on this button to see all your Codecks team hands](./images/hand/TeamHands.png)

If a Card inside a Hand is not accessible to you (e.g. it is a ghost Card - see below - or is inside a project to which you have no access), it will be shown as _inaccessible_ Card featuring the icon of our rogue figure. Accordingly your own private Cards are never shared with your team members and shown as inaccessible to your team members, even if you add it your own Hand. They will see that the Hand slot is occupied by a Card but not be able to get further information. This still relays information the information to them that you're busy with something, but not what exactly.

In addtion, both your Hand as well as each Team Hand offer to pick a [Default Inbox Deck](/decks/#default-inbox-deck) via the button at the top right.

## Bookmarks

Bookmarks allow you to keep a shortlist of any set of Cards, even those that are not owned by you. You may use these to quickly access document Cards that you need to look up often. You can bookmark an unlimited amount of Cards and rearrange them freely by drag'n'dropping Cards into place.

A Card can be added to the bookmark list by clicking the bookmark button on the bottom right side of each opened Card. You can also bookmark new Cards right away by toggling the bookmark icon when creating a new Card.

**Ghost Cards** (see below) will always be bookmarked automatically so you won't lose them. Archiving a Card will also remove them from the bookmark tab. To retrieve archived bookmarks you can hit the "Open bookmarks in search view" at the right of the panel and include archived Cards in the search panel.

## Activity

![Click on this button to see all your Codecks activity](./images/hand/Activity.png)

The activity button in the left action bar allows you to inspect all your recent activity. Use the button on top of the activity list to enable/disable activity types. By default all activity types are shown. Enabling a filter will only show activities of that type. You can switch to the activity list of other team members by using the user selection box in the top right of the screen.

You can also access the activity list of an individual team member by clicking the activity icon that appears on hover in the top right corner of each Hand inside the Team Hands section.

## Your Cards

![Click on this button to see all your Codecks Cards](./images/hand/YourCards.png)

Beyond the Cards inside your Hand, you may see all Cards assigned to you throughout all visible projects and decks by clicking the button featuring your portrait on the left hand side of the Hand tab. As anywhere you can also use the shortcut `q` to access this view quickly.

## Ghost Cards

![Ghost Card](./images/hand/GhostCards.png)

If you don't specify a deck during the Card creation process, the Card becomes a private ghost Card. That means that the content of the Card is hidden from all other team members. You can't share it via comments or by passing the URL around. You can use these Cards to keep personal notes (_e.g. if you want to edit your radical design proposal before shocking the rest of the team_).

To convert a ghost Card into a regular Card, just put it into a deck. This makes the Card findable by your teammates and lets them appreciate your creation. Note that this isn't reversible: i.e once a Card is in a deck you can't turn it into a private Card anymore.

You can recognize ghost Cards by the cute ghost icon at the bottom of the Card. If you're wondering why a Card is not showing up for somebody else, making sure that you didn't create a ghost Card is a good thing to check first.

Card Basics
===================


# Text Editor

Cards can be as simple as containing brief task descriptions or as extensive as complex design documents.

## Formatting

The card text editor supports the [markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Once you save the card, it will be rendered in a way that turns your text, lists and headers into nice looking documents.

<Aside>
  The good thing about markdown is that writing it feels relatively natural since its formatting
  rules are organic and human-readable. You will also get a nice diff view in the history panel for
  any changes to the card text.
</Aside>

To help you with the syntax we've added some helpers.

### Slash Command

![slash command overlay](./images/text-editor/slash-commands.png)

You can type `/` anywhere in the editor to open this overlay. It'll allow you to explore both markdown features as well as codecks-sepecific features such as mentioning co-workers or referencing other cards.

### Floating Action Bar

![Floating action bar above some selected text](./images/text-editor/floating-action-bar.png)

If you start selecting text, an action bar will show up allowing you to format the selected text. Available formatting options are: bold, italic, strike through, code and links.

### Preview

If you are unsure how something will look on the final card, you can use the preview mode to see how your formatting will look without having to save the card the first.

### Markdown Mini Cheat Sheet

Check out this [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for more examples like embedding tables or images. Note that Codecks does not support using HTML within markdown.

## Focus Mode

![Button that allows to enter focus mode](./images/text-editor/focus-mode.png)

At the top right of an opened card you are able to find the Focus Mode button. Focus Mode allows you to view and edit on a full screen view without any distractions. For even more focus you can enter the `Full Screen` mode at the top right corner of a card in focus mode.

## Checklists

![Checklists in edit mode and after they got saved](<./images/text-editor/1 Checklists.png>)

If you want to split up a task into sub steps you may use checklists. The syntax for checklists looks like:

```
- [ ] a task for me
- [ ] another task
- [x] one more task which is already done
- [] works without space as well
```

Saving this card text will show a list of checklist items. You can use the mouse to check off the items directly on the card. You can manually create a checked-off checklist item by putting an 'x' between the square brackets as shown above. Whenever you mark a checklist item as done using the mouse, the text is automatically updated to stay in sync.

Similar to any other activity, changes to checklists are also visible in the history panel of each card.

Checklists are great for items that are managed on a single card. To create more powerful sub cards, please check the [hero cards](/hero-cards/) documentation.

## Referencing other cards

![referencing cards in the editor](<./images/text-editor/2 Referencing other cards.png>)

Entering `$` will pop open a list of other recently touched cards. You may modify the content of the list by entering a couple more letters to narrow down the search card list. You can also search for multiple words by separating them with `_`. Select the card you want to reference by using the mouse or by using the arrow keys and confirming with tab or enter. A color-coded link will be entered in the card text.

This is a great way to build multi-card documents in a wiki-style, allowing you to build your full [GDD](https://www.codecks.io/blog/2020/writing-modern-game-design-documents/) in Codecks. The link shows the title and workflow state of the linked card. Hovering over the link will open a mini preview of the referenced card. If you change the title or workflow state of referenced cards, the link will update its appearance automatically as well. Clicking the link opens the referenced card.

You may also reference another card by copy'n'pasting the URL of another card. It will automatically convert the link into a short-hand reference link. To get the URL of a card you can also just click on the dollar sign label shown on top of each opened card.

URLs of cards contain the title so that other people can already infer what the card is about when you paste it into an email or chat. It is good to know that those links remain valid even if the card content changes, so you don't have to worry about breaking links by changing the card text.

These references also work inside of comments.

## Referencing decks

Similar to cards, you can use `$$` to add a deck reference. These deck references will result in clickable elements linking straight to the deck view.

## Referencing team members

![referencing team members in the editor](<./images/text-editor/3 Referencing team members.png>)

Entering `@` will open a list of your team members. You can narrow down the content list by entering some letters of the user name that you want to reference. Selecting an entry via mouse or keyboard will add a link to that user and notify them of the fact that they were mentioned on this card.
Mentioning a user within a card automatically leads to that user watching that card. This means they will receive notifications for important updates to the card.
Mentioning a user within a comment adds them to the conversation if they're not already present.

## Wide Mode

![wide mode in action](./images/text-editor/4-wide-mode.gif)

If you want to focus on writing or reading a longer document, you can extend the width of the card container by dragging it with your mouse. This setting will be remembered on your browser.

## Emojis

![list of emojis](<./images/text-editor/5 Emojis.png>)

Entering `:` and a letter will open the emoji selector allowing you to choose an emoji from the list. As you enter more letters the list will be filtered by emojis fitting to your search word.

You don't have to remember the precise emoji name as we have categorized our emojis via keywords. For example entering `:hand` will also offer you the `:pinchedfingers:` emoji although technically the emoji name does not contain the word **hand**. 🦸

## Images & Videos

![showing images in the editor](<./images/text-editor/6 Images.png>)

There are two ways to add an image or video to your card or comment:

1. If you've got an image or video in your clipboard you can simply paste it into the opened editor. It'll upload the file and add it at your cursor's location. The file will also be added as an [attachment](/attachments/).
2. If you already added an image or video as attachment, you can enter `!`. This will open a list of attachments to insert. Use your mouse or keyboard to select the image.

Inserted images can be viewed with our image viewer. Note that video playback depends on browser support for the provided video file.

## Tags

![tag picker in the editor](<./images/text-editor/7 Tags.png>)

Entering `#` will open a list of available tags. Typing more characters will filter the list. You can always "invent" new tags by continuing to type without confirming any suggested tags. For more information on how to work with tags and the difference between project tags and personal tags, refer to the [Tags](/tags/) section.



# Owner

You can assign an owner to each card. The owner usually refers to the person that has actionable work to do on this card or that is responsible for reaching the goal of the card.

<Aside>

Being able to assign multiple people can introduces confusion and a lack of clear ownership, sometimes resulting in work not getting done because of "I thought the other person would do it.". Only allowing one owner per card is a conscious decision based on our real-life experience. For project management and task ownership **sharing is not caring**.

If a task involves two or more people there are two mechanisms you can use:

1. You can either create a [hero card](/hero-cards/) and add each persons task as a sub card

![Hero Card](./images/owner/hero-card.png)

2. Or you can use reviews as a hand-over mechanism. Since a review is conversation-bound, the two participants can have a conversation to make sure all necessary information is present.

</Aside>

## Assigning owner

![Owner picker in sidebar](./images/owner/picker.png)

Open the properties sidebar by clicking on the top button to the right of an opened card. You can also click on the user portrait icon of a card and it will open the sidebar and highlight the owner input area.

![Card showing a portrait](./images/owner/portrait.png)

You can use the user input field to type the name of an user and to select them from the list or click on one of the proposed username buttons. To remove any owner use the 'None' button.

The list of potential owners is restricted to the people that have access to the card based on the deck it is in. If you don't see a person make sure to put the card into a deck that you share with that person.

You can also use this **shortcut** to assign a card to yourself: hover your mouse cursor over a card and press the `spacebar` to assign it to yourself. If the card was already assigned to yourself, pressing the space button will set the card to in-progress.

You can also use the bulk action bar to set the owner of multiple cards at once. By default new cards don't have any owner set.

![Bulk Action](./images/owner/bulk-action.png)

You're also able to drag and drop cards into the corresponding owner swim lane if your current view is sorted by owner.

Finally there's the [Quick Settings](/quick-settings/) to modify the owner as well as other properties.

<Adventure>

You find yourself in the dungeon’s gift shop. You see little plushies of the Card Witch. Adorable! A pimply goblin youth sits idly behind the counter. Crude text on his apron reads: “Ask me about the Time Machine”. The A has been traced with red spraypaint. Radical! Some items here look quite valuable. These diamonds could fetch a fortune… Perhaps you could steal them… smash the displays, grab the diamonds and [try to flee the scene](/sorting/)? But this could get you in trouble . You could always just [ask the goblin youth for directions](/workflow/) to this “Time Machine”.

</Adventure>



# Priority

![Cards with different priorities](./images/priority/1-priority.png)

You can use priority to signal how important a card is. The priority is shown in the bottom right corner of a card.

A card can have one of three priority levels:

- High
- Medium
- Low

You can also use 'none' priority to mark cards that yet have to receive a priority or for cards where a priority makes no sense. By default new cards are created with no priority.

## Assigning priority

![Priority prop panel](./images/priority/2-assigning-priority.png)

Open the properties sidebar by clicking on the top button to the right of an opened card. You may also click on the priority icon and it will open the sidebar and highlight the priority input field. Click on one of the priority icons to set the new priority value.

**Cool shortcut**: hover your mouse cursor over the priority icon of a card and press the keyboard keys 1, 2 or 3 to set the card priority to low, medium or high priority.

You may also use the bulk action button to set priority of multiple cards.

Another option is to drag and drop cards if your current view is sorted by priority.

Finally there's the [Quick Settings](/quick-settings/) to modify the priority amongst other properties.

<Adventure>

The goblin Overseer comes to see you. He is much bigger than the other goblins, broadchested and built like an ox, the Overseer fixes you with a menacing stare. “Well, well, well. An adventurer. Came looking for the Hero Card, huh?” He cracks his knucles. “Tell you the truth. Never liked the Witch. I’ll help you… for a price. And if you can’t pay, well, then I’ll return you to where you belong.” If you have something valuable on you, you can try and [bribe the Overseer](/hero-cards/). If, however, you have nothing, you just have to hope that the Overseer won’t drag you into a torture chamber. [Or worse](/owner/).

</Adventure>

## Customizing priority

![Account Settings](./images/priority/3-customizing-priority.png)

You can customize the priority labels from your organization settings (reachable via the joystick button). This allows you to use custom labels for each of the priority levels.

A popular alternative to the standard labels are:

- Must Have
- Medium
- Bonus

## Sorting and searching

![Filter by priorities](./images/priority/4b-sorting-and-searching.png)

You can see all cards sorted by priority in ascending or descending order by using the corresponding order-by priority button. You can also search for all cards up to a certain priority level, at least at a certain priority level or exactly at a certain priority level. Just start typing into the search bar and make sure to use the priority labels that you set up.

![Sorting by priority](./images/priority/4a-sorting-and-searching.png)



# What is effort?

Effort is a value that expresses the estimated quantity of work described on this card. What the value specifically means is up to you and your team. You can use it to represent time units like hours or days or you use it to represent more relative units like story points. Together with [priority](/priority/) it is the backbone of your scope management.

<Aside>

In our experience the first one (time units) is easier to grasp for new teams. Here's a quick reasoning for using the latter (relative units): let's assume you estimate a task to take 5 hours and let's assume over time you amass dozens of tasks. As you get better at these, the time required to do similar tasks usually goes down. After working on the project for a couple of months, a task that initially required 5 hours to complete might now only need 3 hours. This means that your estimates can go out of sync and that you have to update them regularly.

The idea behind using relative measures is to keep the estimate for tasks somewhat fixed. Let's say you measure animating your standard Orc enemy in the game as 1 point and measure all other enemies relative to that. As you get better at animating, you won't have to update your estimates but instead plan for completing more points. Bumping up your personal work estimate per week is much easier than updating a backlog of many cards.

This also makes it easier to share effort estimates. Your senior animator might plan for 25 weekly points and the junior animator for 15 weekly points, without having to update individual card estimates based on who is working on it.

Having said that, it can be hard to establish even for experienced teams, as we're all human and have a natural tendency for using time based metrics. In either case we let you choose which model you prefer :)

</Aside>

## Assigning effort

![Effort picker](<./images/effort/1 Assigning effort.png>)

Open the properties sidebar by clicking on the top button to the right of an opened card. You may also click on the effort number and it will open the sidebar and highlight the effort input field.

You can click on the numbers to set the effort to the corresponding number. You can also use the input field to enter any number manually.

Cool **shortcut**: Hovering your mouse pointer over the effort area of any card and pressing a number keyboard button will set the effort to that. This works on both - the mini cards and also opened cards.

As with most other properties you can also update cards by dragging and dropping them into the corresponding swim lane if your current view is sorted by effort.

Finally there's the [Quick Settings](/quick-settings/) to modify the effort amongst other card properties.

## Effort Scales

![Changing effort scales in the organization settings](<./images/effort/2 Effort Scales.png>)

You can customize the default effort numbers by going into your organization settings and choosing from..

- Linear (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
- Fibonacci (0,1,2,3,5,8)
- Exponential (0,1,2,4,8,16)

This comes down to a matter of taste. You may also use the input field to enter any number (including those outside of the scale) manually.

You can use the bulk action bar to set the effort on multiple cards at once. By default new cards don't have any effort assigned yet.

<Adventure>

You are hurtling through time and space. You seem to be floating through a tunnel of sorts. A blue box passes you by with a roar. On it’s side a big T is spray painted in crimson. All around you are colors and strange sounds. In the distance below you see a ship on unquiet waters. It’s being pushed around by strong winds. If you wanted, you could [steer towards that ship](/open-decks/). You could try and just [get out of that strange tunnel](/text-editor/).

</Adventure>

## Using effort

![Accumulated effort shown in a swimlane](<./images/effort/3 Using effort.png>)

Make sure you populate this field to enjoy all the project metrics we offer.

We also show effort on top of a lot of the swim lanes that split cards between sorting dimensions. For example: if you choose to sort your cards by [owner](/owner/), you'll see an effort tracking label next to each user name. The label has the format N (M).

N means the sum of all card efforts in this section. M is the number of all cards in this section which don't have any effort associated. We generally advise to use efforts everywhere, including setting cards to zero effort if they are negligible.

Another way to quickly add up effort points is to use the selection feature. The effort icon in the bulk selection header will also show the summed up effort of selected cards. (Did you know you can quickly select lots of cards using shift once you've selected the first card?)

Clicking on the effort icon will open the [quick settings](/quick-settings/), which allow you to quickly set [priority](/priority/), effort, deck and [owner](/owner/) of a card.

## Hero Cards

[Hero cards](/hero-cards/) automatically add up the effort of all their contained sub cards. You may add a custom effort for the hero card itself.



# Attachments

Beyond texts, cards can contain various attachments. You can inspect the attachments of a card by clicking on the paper-clip button to the right side of an opened card.

![Clip Icon](./images/attachments/clip.png)

You can recognize cards containing attachments by the small paper-clip icon on them. Here's a nice **shortcut**: clicking on the icon will open the card with the attachment sidebar already expanded.

## Adding attachments

When dropping any file onto Codecks, the cards will update their look to highlight that you may drop the attachment onto any card on the screen. You may also browse for a file to upload clicking the _browse_ button in the attachments sidebar.

![Drop area](./images/attachments/drop-area.png)

Our favorite way of adding attachments is by pasting via the keyboard (CTRL+V on Windows and CMD+V on Mac). This is the fastest way of getting an image from your image editing software or screenshot tool into Codecks. You may also use this to add a image directly into the [card text](/text-editor/).

## Attachments Sidebar

![Opened Attachment Sidebar](./images/attachments/sidepanel.png)

The attachments sidebar contains all the attached files. Using the buttons on the top you may filter the attachments by type or change their sorting order.

Below you'll see all the attached files with information who added them and when. Individual attachments may also be downloaded onto your machine or deleted.

Clicking on images opens them in the Codecks image viewer. The viewer allows you to zoom and pan the image without leaving Codecks. In the image viewer you may use the arrow buttons to jump between other images attached to the same card.

If a video was uploaded you may watch it inline if your Browser supports playback of the file.

If your attachment order is set to _newest first_ pressing the left arrow will jump to newer images, the right arrow will jump to older images. If you are sorting by _oldest first_ this order is reversed. You sort preference is persisted across all cards.

<Adventure>

You rummage through library supplies when the glint of metal catches your eye. A sword! You now have a sword. There is another small door here and behind it you hear faint snoring. [Do you go through](/users/)? On the wall, the letter K is written in red spray paint. Next to the letter, behind one of the boxes, you also see what appears to be a tunnel that you could [explore](/shortcuts/). But, of course, you could also [return to the tour of the library](/activity/).

</Adventure>

## Image Cover

You may also use images as card cover images by clicking on the eye icon next to the image. This will open the Image Cover Editor allowing you to fine tune the position of the image. You may also chose whether to render a light or dark title on top of it. Blurring the bottom may be helpful for noisy backgrounds which might make it hard to identify the icons.

## Managing File Storage

The file storage limit for your account is based on the pricing plan of your organization:

- Free: 1GB Total
- Plus: 1GB / User
- Pro: 5GB / User
- Enterprise: Unlimited

To see how much file storage you are currently using, enter Mission Control (joystick icon in the top left) and click on the _Files_ button. This opens up your files library showing you the total amount of attachments and file size in use. From there you can delete large files that you don't need anymore. This view can also be useful as an alternative way for finding a specific attachment.



# Tags

In Codecks each card lives in only one deck at a time. This makes the project more manageable and nudges you towards creating a reasonable project structure.

Tags allow to extend that basic structure by assigning searchable labels to cards which extend over Decks, Runs or Milestones. You can use these to find all cards relating to a certain theme independent of which Deck, Run or Milestone they're currently in. Cards can have as many tags as you like.

## Assigning tags

You can assign a card tag by writing `#` followed by the tag name in the text of the card. Entering the hashtag character pops open a list of tag proposals which you can select or narrow down by inserting more characters.

![Tag picker in while writing](./images/tags/assign-in-card.png)

Alternatively you may assign and unassign a project tag by using the tag shortcuts in the properties sidebar of any card. Tags that are assigned this way are not added as part of the card text, but kept in a special tag area at the bottom of the card. For searchability or sorting there is no difference between these two tagging styles.

![Tag picker in sidebar](./images/tags/sidebar.png)

You may also assign tags by using the bulk action bar to add and remove tags to multiple cards.

![Bulk action](./images/tags/bulk-action.png)

## Project tags and user tags

<Aside>
We have loved tags since web2.0. _Aging ourselves a bit here_ but if you have ever worked with them in other tools you might have come across the following consistency issue: people using tag names like _issue_ , _issues_ , _bug_ , _bugs _ , _ problem_ , _bugreport_ or _aaaaaarghh_ to mark bug reports and using all these variations interchangeably and at the same time. Long documents are written with how to use the proper tag taxonomy but things still get out of hand quickly. Good luck reliably looking up entries in a system like that.

We have a solution for that!

</Aside>

In Codecks we separate between user tags and project tags. Project tags are officially sanctioned tags which are part of the agreed-upon custom tag taxonomy of your project.

Project tags can only be configured by the project admin and only project tags are shown in the sidebar when creating or editing cards. In case you want to break out of the confined and regulated world of project tags, you can do that too though! These unofficial tags are called user tags and created or assigned with the `#` character in card text.

You can recognize if you're using a project tag or a user tag by looking at the visual representation of the tag. Project tags are highlighted using a black background and the text being shown in white color. User tags are shown as plain colored hashtags.

## Administering tags

To edit project tags click on the _manage_ button in the project tags area of the properties sidebar of any card. You can also go to the **Project tags** section of your project settings.

There you will find a full list of all created tags. From here you can add new tags and rename or remove existing tags. Renaming tags will also update all cards having the old tag to use the new tag instead. This includes updating the card text where the tag name is mentioned by text.

Note that removing a project tag from the settings will _not_ remove all tag instances on cards. Instead they'll show up as 'Deprecated tags' within a card's properties panel.

![Manage Project Tags](./images/tags/manage-project-tags.png)

You may update your personal user tags in the same style by clicking on _my profile_ portrait in the mission control area (reachable via the joystick button in the top left). Note that updating your personal tags won't trigger any card changes.

## Visual Tag Markers

From the project tags admin interface (see above) you can assign a custom color or emoji to each project tag.

### Tag Emoji

You can assign a emoji to a project tag. This will make any card with that tag show the emoji in front of its card title. If the card has multiple emoji tags they will all be shown. Emojis are a great way for highlighting the card tags.

### Tag Colors

Pick one of our pre-defined colors or enter your own hex-based color value.

Setting up a color will add a colored dot onto your cards so that you can visually quickly recognize them. Should the card reference multiple colored tags, the dot will be rendered as a pie chart style dot reflecting all the colors of the associated tags. You can hover the dot(s) to get a textual representation of the tags.

## Auto Tagging

For each Deck, you may automatically assign one project tag. Any card that is created in that deck or moved into that deck will have the chosen tag automatically applied to it. Removing the card from the deck or disabling the auto-tag feature on the deck will also automatically remove the tag again. You can access this feature by clicking the 🤖 button on any deck header bar.

<Aside>

Combining auto tags and tag emojis is a great way for making your cards more readable at first glance.. especially if your hand tends to consist of cards from multiple projects.

</Aside>

See this video for a walk-through and examples:

<Youtube id="MTt8JC2D7zk" />

<Adventure>
  You walk over to a wild bunch of young goblins to introduce yourself. These goblins are not
  interested in working for the Card Witch. Instead, they decided tor practice their own art. They
  lead you on a tour through the Mountain to show the artful tags they left all over the place. They
  show you a giant mural, featuring the letter R. If you keep your eyes open, you could find more of
  these tags all over the dungeon. Some of the cool goblins want to [go jump into the old Time
  Machine](/time-tracking/), you could tag along. Others want to go [hang out in the diamond
  mines](/milestones/), another interesting option.
</Adventure>

## Searching and Sorting

You may use tags as search filter by clicking on a tag link inside a card or by typing the tag name into the search bar. The search bar will automatically recognize tag names and offer the fitting search completion even if you don't lead your input with `#`.

![Tags within search](./images/tags/search.png)

Using the _order-by_ option with tags you can sort cards by project tags, user tags or both.

There is also a tag based selection button (designated with the `#` icon) which allows you to select all cards that share a certain tag. If you select multiple tags, the _and_ and _or_ buttons on top of the order area become enabled. They allow you to switch between searching for cards that share **all** the selected tags or cards that contain **any** of the selected tags.



# Doc Cards

In addition to tracking tasks, Codecks can also be used to manage game design documents and other reference material: Doc Cards are made specificaly for this.

### Creating Doc Cards

![Select this button to turn a Task Card into a Doc Card](<./images/doc-cards/1 Creating Doc Cards.png>)

You can turn any Task Card into a Doc Cards by selecting the Doc icon on the bottom right side of an opened card (or use the bulk action bar to convert multiple cards in one step). Doc Cards can be converted back into a Task Card at any point by selecting the same icon.

### Doc Cards features

![This is how a Doc Card looks like](<./images/doc-cards/2 Doc Cards features.png>)

This is what sets Doc Cards apart from regular Task Cards:

- No [workflow states](/workflow/): this prevents from accidentally setting document content to Done and having the card archived
- No [priority](/priority/) or [effort](/effort/)
- Word count always visible in the bottom right corner, both in mini and expanded card view
- Dedicated swimlane when ordering by Priority, Effort or Status

### Making the most out of Doc Cards

![An example of a Doc Card including backlinks](<./images/doc-cards/3 Making the most out of Doc Cards.png>)

In order to build wiki-like structures we recommend referencing other cards using $-links, which can be inserted by typing `$` or by copy’n’pasting the URL of another card (more about this in the [Text Editor](/text-editor/) entry on our Manual). This will add a backlink at the bottom of the card for faster navigation.

It's also possible to bundle up multiple Doc Cards under a [Hero Card](/hero-cards/). Hero Cards consisting only of Doc Cards get a dedicated Doc Hero Card look.

Organizing Cards
===================


# Decks

![Deck Collection](./images/decks/intro.png)

Each Card in Codecks can belong to exactly one Deck. Your collection of Decks can be found in the **Decks tab**. This tab essentially serves as your project's backlog – a collection of all your tasks, ideas, and bugs that you might address at various points in the future, or perhaps not at all. It's the central repository for everything, from broad, ambitious concepts to concrete, actionable tasks.

## Organizing Your Decks

<Aside>
  We recommend setting up two types of Decks for each of your projects:

1. **GDD Decks** which contain cards for your high-level assets. E.g. an `Enemy` Deck which contains one Card per enemy.
2. **Tasks Decks** for each discipline. E.g. `Coding Tasks` or `Art Tasks`. Cards within these Decks are typically sub cards of Cards within a GDD Deck.

That way you maintain a good high-level overview over the state of your assets within the GDD Decks, while your team members can find their relevant tasks within the respective Task Deck.

</Aside>

### Deck Types

To enforce the structure described above, you can restrict the allowed Card types within each Deck.

![Card Types](./images/decks/card-types.png)

Note that this allows you to create empty hero cards, by having a Card within a Deck that allows Hero Cards but no Task Cards.

There is a default setting here for each deck that depends on the Space it is in (see below).

- **GDD** new Decks only allow Hero Cards by default
- **Tasks** new Decks only allow Task Cards by default
- **Knowledge** new Decks only allow [Doc Cards](/doc-cards/) by default

### Using Spaces for Navigation

[Spaces](/projects/) within Projects can be used to further categorize and separate different Deck types, which greatly helps with navigation and organization within your project.

![Decks with Spaces](./images/projects/spaces.png)

### Deck Descriptions

You can add descriptions to each Deck. This makes it easier for your team to quickly identify where specific Cards belong and how those Cards should be structured, ensuring consistency and clarity.

### Default Inbox Deck

To simplify Card creation, Codecks allows you to set a default inbox Deck per user. This means Cards created by a specific user can be automatically placed in their designated Deck (e.g., new art tasks go directly to the "Art Tasks" Deck).

To configure a default inbox deck for your team members you can use the button on the top right of the [Team Hands](/hand/#team-hands).

## Decks in the Codecks Workflow

Decks are a fundamental part of how work is managed and progressed in Codecks.

### Relationship with Cards

- Every Card can be assigned to at most one Deck.
- If you don't specify a Deck when creating a Card, it becomes a private Ghost Card, hidden from other team members. To make it visible and shareable, you must place it into a Deck.
- Once a Card is in a Deck, it can't be made private again.

### Interaction with Other Features

- **Milestones and Runs**: You can assign any Card from your Decks to a [milestone](/milestones/) or a [Run](/runs/) to schedule your work.
- **Hand**: For your next immediate tasks, you might move Cards straight from the Decks tab into your [hand](/hand/).
- **Project Structure**: [Projects](/projects/) are containers for Decks. When setting up a new project, you might create spaces like `Tasks` with Decks for work areas (coding, animation) or `GDD` with Decks for game assets (enemies, levels).
- **Sorting and Filtering**: You can [sort and filter](/sorting/) the Cards within any Deck to view them in different ways, such as by priority or owner. Decks also support a `Manual` order where you can define a custom order via drag and drop, which is shared with the team.
- **Default Order**: You can define a [**Default Order**](/sorting/#default-view) for how Cards are displayed in a Deck. This shared preference will be the initial view for team members or public visitors (if part of Open Decks, see below).
- **Tags**: For each Deck, you can [automatically assign](/tags/#auto-tagging) one project tag. This can be configured by clicking the 🤖 button on any Deck header bar.
- **Journeys**: [Journeys](/hero-cards/#journeys) (template-based Sub Card creation) are always associated with Decks. To prepare a Journey, you open a Deck and click on the Journey button on the Deck header bar.
- **Guardians**: The [Guardians](/guardians/) feature, which helps manage Card completion workflows, can be enabled in the header area of any opened Deck by looking for the shield icon. Only appointed Guardians (and Producers/Admins) can then mark Cards in that Deck as done directly.
- **Open Decks**: When you make a project public using [Open Decks](/open-decks/), visitors will see all the Decks contained in that public project. You can set a default Card order for these public Decks. Quick links (🌍 icon) to the public page of a Deck appear on the Deck header.



# Projects

A project is a container for decks as well as an instrument for limiting access within your organization. Each deck belongs to exactly one project. An organization may create multiple projects. On the Free plan you can create up to 5 projects. On paid plans there's no limit to the number of projects you can create.

<Aside>

Projects are used for defining what content a user has access to. Take a look at the [User Management](/users/) page to learn more.

</Aside>

## Creating a project

By default your account will already contain one project. To create a new project, open the mission control side panel (click on the joystick icon in the top left) and use the _add_ button next to the project's label. You can use drag and drop to change the sorting position in which your new project is shown. This sorting position is user-specific and won't affect the order for anyone else in the team.

## Setting a project image

You can already assign an image during the creation step. If you want to set the background image of an existing project, drag and drop an image file onto the project tile in the sidebar or use the Project Settings.

<Adventure>

This is it. The fabled vault of the Card Witch. In front of you is an immense round door made of heavy steel. You are certain. Behind this door you will find the treasure ot the Card Witch. But the door is not budging. It is locked. Next to the door you see a small slot, just big enough to fit a card… If you carry the key card, [insert it](/due-dates/). Without the key card, there is nothing left to do but to [go back](/workflow/).

</Adventure>

## Managing visibility

You can use mission control (click on joystick at top) to show and hide projects quickly. Use this depending on whether you want to focus on a single project or prefer to have an overview of everything that is happening.

Click on the checkbox or anywhere on the project tile to show or hide the project. You can also click on the bullseye button to hide all other projects and only show the selected project.

If you hide a project you will not see any cards belonging to decks within that project. You will still see notifications for all projects though, so you won't miss anything important going on in other projects.

## Archiving Projects

If you don't need active access to a project anymore, you can archive it using its project settings screen. You can access the project settings by clicking the gear icon on the project tile (once you hover your mouse there).

Archived projects are removed from the mission control list and all its cards won't be visible to you anymore. You may restore archived projects at any time by selecting "Show archived projects" in the Mission Control.

## Deleting Projects

In case you feel strongly about not just archiving a project, but completely eradicating any memory of it (_we've all been there_), you can delete it from the project settings screen.

Be aware that there is now way of restoring that data easily. If you regret your choice for any reason, reach out to us and let us know. We might be able to restore your project from backup.

## Decks View and Spaces

![Decks with Spaces](./images/projects/spaces.png)

A project can further be subdivided into Spaces. A **Default Space** will automatically be assigned to each project. Look for the **Add Space** button to create a new one. Once created, Spaces can be edited and moved. Only Spaces without decks can be deleted. Spaces can be collapsed by clicking on the top area.

Decks can freely be moved within and across spaces. Changing the order will change it for all members of the team. Be aware that moving a deck from one project to another might imply that some users might gain or lose access to the deck depending on the settings of the new project. If these changes have impact on already running conversations you will get a warning about how moving the deck will influence the ongoing discussions. It will also warn you if card owners don't have access to the target deck.

To change the order in which projects are shown in the decks view, open the Mission Control and change the order of the project tiles via drag and drop.



# Sorting & Grouping

Codecks comes with a powerful grouping mechanism. Learn how to slice and dice your cards to surface the important stuff.

<Youtube id="MPTy3lrag6A" />

#### Basic principles

![Order options](./images/sorting/sorting-overview.png)

The order button shows up in three contexts:

1. Search results
2. Decks
3. Milestones

You can find it in the action bar to the left.

By default, cards will be grouped by `Manual` in milestones and by `Priority` everywhere else. By using the order panel (shortcut `shift+o`) you can pick any of the other available orders:

- [Priority](/priority/)\*
- [Effort](/effort/)\*
- [Workflow state](/workflow/)\*
- [Tags](/tags/)\*
- [Owner](/owner/)\*
- [Run](/runs/)\*
- [Milestone](/milestones/)\*
- Last updated
- Creation date
- Deck\*
- [Project](/projects/)
- Title
- [Upvotes](/discord/)
- [Time tracked](/time-tracking/)
- [Due date](/due-dates/)
- [Hero Card](/hero-cards/)\*
- [Beast Level](/runs/#beast-mode)
- Manual (see below)

<Aside>

**Drag and drop interactions**

All orders marked with a `*` in the list above can be used to change a card's property via drag and drop. You can either drop a card directly into one of the other lanes or use the drop area to the right which will show a full list of available options.

</Aside>

To get a more compact view, you can activate the `Compact` toggle at the bottom. This will group all cards into a single swim lane. Tags do not support a compact view as a card can show up multiple times if it has more than one tag.

#### Manual Order and Zones

![Zones](./images/sorting/sorting-zones.png)

Decks and Milestones have special order: `Manual`. This allows to define a custom order via drag and drop which is shared amongst the team.

Note that within Manual order, relative positioning of cards is preserved when moving them from one milestone or deck to the next.

Rather than working with predefined swimlanes, Manual order allows you to define `Zones`. Cards can be freely moved across and within Zones.

If you have the [permission](/users/) to modify the respective Deck or Milestone, you can create Zones via the `Add Zone` Button at the bottom. If you hover over the Zone name, you can modify its name or change the order. Empty zones can be deleted via the edit dialog.

You can use the `+` icon at the end of each zone to directly add a new card to it. When cards are added another way (either via moving them into the deck or milestone, or via creating them with the red plus button) they are always added at the end of the top-most Zone.

#### Table View

![Table View](./images/sorting/table-view.png)

The Pro plan unlocks the Table View option. This is especially helpful for browsing large deck contents. You can find the option it at the bottom of the sort panel.
It supports all sorting options as well as the drag and drop operations of both the manual mode and the other supported sorting options.

#### The swim lane header

![Swim lane header](./images/sorting/sorting-swimlane-header.png)

<Aside>

**What is a swim lane?**

The term "swim lane" has been borrowed from the Kanban methodology. It describes the sections by which a Kanban board has been split into. Typically those sections sections reflect the workflow state of a card (pending, started, done). Codecks allows you to mimic these type of swim lanes by ordering by "Workflow state".

Note that while typical Kanban swim lanes are vertical, Codecks uses a horizontal approach to make better use of space in the more typical scenarios of having few lanes with a lot of content.

</Aside>

The swim lane header consists of up to three parts:

1. **Swim lane label:** Most sorting order allow you to click on the label to add the underlying property as a search entry. This allows you to quickly drill down on interesting properties by continuously iterating search terms and order.
2. **Select all button:** This button only shows when hovering the area with the mouse. It allows you to quickly select all cards of the swim lane. **Pro tip:** if you selected a single card of a swim lane and hitting `ctrl/cmd + a` will select all cards of the current swim lane. Hitting `ctrl/cmd + a` once again will select all visible cards.
3. **Effort summary**: if at least one card in a swim lane has an effort set, this section will be present. It shows the effort of all cards. The number in brackets indicate the number of cards without an effort set. I.e. cards with an effort of "None".
4. **Time tracking summary**: If at least one card has time tracking information associated with it, this section will be shown. Hovering it will show a pop which breaks down the tracked time by user.

<Adventure>

You were captured and made prisoner. You are in damp cell in the bowels of the Witch’s Mountain. The letter O is spraypainted on the wall with bright yellow paint. There is nothing here to do but to await judgment. Unless… is that a loose brick at the far wall there? You pry it open. Behind it, you can see a dark tunnel. You could [crawl into the tunnel and escape](/shortcuts/)! But to escape from jail would be against the law. You could [wait for a fair trial](/priority/)?

</Adventure>

#### Secondary search order

For cards that share the same attribute of the primary sort order there's an implicit secondary sort order. It's based on priority, then effort and lastly creation date. So if you order by e.g. "Owner", then high priority cards will be shown first for each owner.

You can overwrite this behavior by `ctrl/cmd + click` on an order button. This will effectively push the selected sort order in front of the implicit order defined above. So if you picked "Milestone" as a secondary order while keeping "Owner" as primary order it'll show cards in the nearest milestone first for cards with the same owner. Cards with the same owner and milestone will again use priority then effort and creation date to sort those further.

You can also define more than one secondary search order by `ctrl/cmd + click`ing on additional buttons. The number next to the button indicates the rank of the selected search order. To reset you can do a normal click on the primary order.

#### Default View

![Default View area](./images/sorting/default-view.png)

Whenever you apply an order in a Deck, Run or Milestone, this choice will be remembered for your browser.

To share your preferences with your team (or in case of a public deck with your audience), you can define a **Default Order**. Do this by looking for the corresponding area at the bottom. When team members or visitors see the Deck, Run or Milestone for the first time they will see cards in the preferred order. They can still pick their own order but will see a small hint at the sort icon as a reminder that they might want to go back to the default view.



# Runs

![Runs in Timeline](./images/runs/intro.png)

Sprints are a common tool in the development process. Runs allow you to model your sprints by allowing to set up recurring milestones of a certain length in weeks.

<Aside>

### Terminology: Run vs Run Configuration

A `Run Configuration` creates `Runs`. Typically you set up one `Run Configuration` per Team. Codecks allows to have multiple `Run Configurations` in parallel.

Here's a translation that you might know from other tools:

**Run Configuration:** Team, Sprint Track\
**Run:** Sprint, Cycle

</Aside>

## Set up Runs

First ensure Runs are enabled via the Organization Settings > Features section. (They are enabled by default though.)

Open the **Timeline** tab in the header or press `Shift + 3` on your keyboard.

Look for the ➕ icon at the top right. A Calendar opens which includes a `Set up Runs` button in the header.

!["Set up Runs" button](./images/runs/setup.png)

### Set up a Run Configuration

![Run Config Menu](./images/runs/run-config.png)

- **Short Name**: Up to 5 letters. Helpful to differentiate Runs in case there exist parallel Run Configurations.
- **Color**: The color in which the Runs are shown throughout the app.
- **Project-specific**: If left unchecked the generated Runs will be _global_ ones, that can contain Cards from any project. If you make it project-specific, it will only be shown on the timeline if the associated project is currently visible as well. This mechanism can also be used to hide certain Runs from team members that don't have access to the respective project.
- **Run duration**: How many weeks a Run is active
- **Run start day**: This option differs depending on whether you are creating or updating a Run Configuration. When creating a Run Config, you can pick a start date from a calendar. When editing, you can change the weekday the Run starts.
- **Number of upcoming Runs to create**: This number also includes the currently active Run. Once a Run has been finished, a new one is automatically created.
- **Finish Sprint At**: Define the time and time zone at which the Run shall end. Note that 0:00 refers to the beginning of the specified end day, while 24:00 refers to the end of that day.
- **Finish Behaviour**: Here you can configure which Cards should be automatically moved to the next Run once a Run is finished.

All settings can be changed later on. Updating the Run duration will only impact the currently running or future Runs. Updating the start day will only impact future Runs and prolong (or shorten the current one).

### Run Automations

Look for the 🤖 icon in the Run Inspector to set up a couple of useful automations:

1. **Auto Milestone**

   Codecks automatically applies the selected milestone to any card added to this Run.

2. **Auto Assign Started Card**

   This Option automatically adds started Cards to the Run, unless they're already in another Run.

3. **Auto Assign New Card**

   New Cards from the Run's projects will be automatically suggested for the Run. You can adjust this before saving the Card.

Note that option 2. and 3. might result in a situation where a Card could be applied to multiple Run Configurations if their projects overlap. In that case the Run Config is chosen whose current Run's end date is closest.

### Run Description, Statistics & User Capacity

Once a Run is opened, you can click on the `i` button below the **Add Card** button on the left. This will show you the description box as well as statistics about the Run including a burndown chart. The description area allows you to update the description and upload a cover image. This image will also be used for the Run's tooltip.

The shown velocity is accumulating done Cards from the full Run Configuration.

![Stats of a Run](./images/runs/stats.png)

This view also includes <b>Capacity Tracking</b>. It shows how work is distributed across your team mates. You can set the individual capacity of each team member to see who might be overbooked or out of work. Look for the ⚙️ icon at the top right to set and modify the capacity for each user.

If a user is overbooked, the line chart will show striped overlay. If a member still has capacity left, it will be represented with dots.
Users are sorted by the percentage of work done (based on work assigned, not capacity). Note that when editing Capacities, the tooltip shows the Historical Workload for a user helping to identify a good value for future workloads.

The Run header also shows your personal capacity vs work load at a quick glance.

![Capacity Tracking Widget](./images/milestones/capa.png)

<Aside>

### Preserved Statistics

Once a Run is finished (the precise time can be set via the settings), all stats are preserved. This allows you a good comparison for how much work was completed at the final day for all past Runs.

</Aside>

### Deleting Runs

You cannot directly delete a Run Configuration, but you can delete active or future Runs. Deleting a Run sets an implicit stop date for that Run Configuration beyond which no new Run is started even if you change e.g. the Run duration.
You can remove the Stop date to resume the Run by opening the Run Configuration via the cog icon ⚙️ on an opened Run.

## Adding Cards to a Run

There are various ways to do so:

- Open the Card properties by clicking the properties button on the top right side of an opened Card, you can find the Run picker below the priority and effort properties. Click the "Pick" button to select either upcoming or past Runs.
- Select multiple Cards and use the bulk action milestone button to add multiple Cards to the same Run.
- Order your Cards by Run to drag Cards between different Run lanes.
- Click on the Run icon on any Card to open the [Quick Settings](/quick-settings/).

There can only be one Run assigned to a Card. To distribute a task over multiple Runs you can consider using [Hero Cards](/hero-cards/).

<Aside>

### Default Order

Just like with Decks and Milestones, you can set a [default order](/sorting/). You can find the option at the bottom section of the sort panel. The default order will be applied by default to everyone in the team.
Setting a default order on a Run sets it for all Runs of the same Run Configuration.
If no default order is set, the Manual sort order is chosen.

</Aside>

## Beast Mode

![Card with Beast token](./images/runs/beast-card.png)

Beast Mode tracks Cards that get pushed from one Run to the next, keeping you aware of what’s slipping through the cracks. The more a Card moves, the stronger its Beast level grows.

A Card within a Run with active Beast mode may be in two states:

1. **Pending:** Cards entering the Run will start out in the `Pending` state. Cards can be moved to different Runs without increasing their Beast level. Cards in the `Pending` state have a `NEW` label at the bottom.
2. **Locked in:** After the grace period has passed, Cards will be locked in. Once locked in, Cards won't be able to move out of this Run without increasing their Beast level.

When opening a Run, you will find the Beast icon in the Run'sheader bar. Codecks offers multiple options to configure Beast Mode.

![Beast Config View](./images/runs/beast-config.png)

- **Manually start Beast mode:** hitting this button will lock all Cards within the Run that have been in the Run for longer than the grace period. This button is available even if you've set up the "Auto Activate" option below. Once Beast Mode is active, the Beast icon will turn red.

- **Auto-activate Beast Mode:** Allows you to set up the number of days after which Beast Mode is activated. This setting affects all Runs within this Run Configuration. Once scheduled, the Beast icon will turn yellow.

- **Beast Grace Period:** The grace period determines how long a Card might be in a Run with activated Beast Mode before being locked in. If a Card has been added to a Run before the Run has started, the Run's start time will be considered for the grace period.

Beast Mode is a feature available in the `Pro` plan.

<Aside>

### Beast Card Ownership

The occurrence of lots of Beast Cards often points towards issues in the
team's development process. Even though the Beast icon is shown near the owner's portrait, it is not an indication of being solely their responsibility. Ultimately, the whole team should jointly aim to keep the number of Beast Cards down and manageable to avoid building a large backlog of overdue Cards.

</Aside>

## Working with Runs

### Run Icons

Cards with a Run will show a small circular-ish arrow icon. Hover over the icon to see more information about the current state of the Run.

Cards with a past Run will show an empty Icon. The current one will be filled whereas future ones are also filled but show a dashed outline.

### Run Tab in the Hand

This section displays all Cards you own across your current [Runs](/run/). You'll see all Runs you have access to. Runs are ordered as follows:

- Runs where you own no cards appear in the bottom group
- Within each group, Runs are ordered by end date, with those ending soonest at the top

For each Run, Cards are grouped by Zone as defined by the Run's [manual order](/sorting/#manual-order-and-zones). You can drag and drop Cards within this section or move them to your Hand above. Click on a Run's name to open the full Run view in the Timeline.



# Milestones

Milestones are important due dates for your projects. These may be public release dates or publisher deliverable deadlines. If you're looking for sprints, have a look at the [Runs](/runs/) feature.

The Timeline tab is one of the three main views in Codecks and home to everything that relates to attaching associating tasks with dates. Each card can be assigned to one Milestone. The Milestone view allows you to see all cards belonging to that Milestone independent of which project, deck or workflow state they are currently in.

## Timeline View

To open the Timeline view clicking on the "Timeline' tab in the header or press `Shift + 3` on your keyboard. To create a Milestone, open the Calendar via the button at the top right of the screen. On the calendar, select the preferred date and enter the new Milestone data.

![Timeline](./images/milestones/timeline.png)

The Timeline view provides an overview of projects' progress via showing Milestones, [Runs](/runs/) and [due dates](/due-dates/). You can use either mouse wheel or drag and drop to move the timeline.

### Features of a Milestone

- Title: The name of the new Milestone. We recommend keeping it short. On some UI elements only the first four letters of the Milestone name are displayed.
- Date: For when this Milestone is due
- Color: The color in which this Milestone is shown throughout the app.
- Project-specific Milestone: If left unchecked the Milestone will be a _global Milestone_ that is always shown. If you make it project-specific, it will only be shown on the timeline if the associated project is currently visible as well. This mechanism can also be used to hide certain Milestones from team members that don't have access to the respective project.

To delete a Milestone, you can click on the bin icon in the Milestone header bar. Doing this won't delete the cards, but unassign all the cards from the deleted Milestone. If the Milestone still contains undone cards, you will get a warning informing you about the number of cards this deletion will affect.

### Milestone Description, Statistics & User Capacity

Once a Milestone is opened, you can click on the `i` button below the **Add Card** button on the left. This will show you the description box as well as statistics about the Milestone including a burndown chart. The description area allows you to update the description and upload a cover image. This image will also be used for the Milestone tooltip.

![Stats of a Milestone](./images/milestones/stats.png)

This view also includes <b>Capacity Tracking</b>. It shows how work is distributed across your team mates. You can set the individual capacity of each team member to see who might be overbooked or out of work. Look for the ⚙️ icon at the top right to set and modify the capacity for each user.

If a user is overbooked, the line chart will show striped overlay. If a member still has capacity left, it will be represented with dots.
Users are sorted by the percentage of work done (based on work assigned, not capacity).

The Milestone header also shows your personal capacity vs work load at a quick glance.

![Capacity Tracking Widget](./images/milestones/capa.png)

### Calendar View and Milestone Overview

The Calendar button at the very top right of the screen allows you to open the Calendar.
The Calendar View allows you to get a high level overview of your Milestones. You can click on any date to create a new Milestone and use drag and drop to move them around. `Ctrl/Cmd+click` will open the Milestone in inspector view behind.

![Calendar](./images/milestones/calendar.png)

Next to the Calendar Butto you can find "Show Overview" button allowing you to view metrics for each of the Milestones.

The data includes the amount of [time tracked](/time-tracking/), the [workflow state](/workflow/) of the cards as well as an overview over the [priority](/priority/) and [owner](/owner/) distribution including their completion rate. The length of these bars use are based on the same unit to allow comparisions accross Milestones.

![Milestone Overview](./images/milestones/milestone-overview.png)

## Assigning Milestones to Cards

You can assign a Milestone to a card in various ways:

- Open the card properties by clicking the properties button on the top right side of an opened card, you can find the Milestone picker below the priority and effort properties. Click the Pick button to allow chosing upcoming and past Milestones.
- Select multiple cards and use the bulk action Milestone button to assign multiple cards to the same Milestone.
- Order your cards by Milestones to easily drag cards between different Milestone lanes.
- Use the [Quick Settings](/quick-settings/).

There can only be one Milestone assigned to a card. To distribute a task over multiple Milestones you can consider using [hero cards](/hero-cards/).

<Aside>

Just like with Decks and Runs, you can set a [default order](/sorting/). You can find the option at the bottom section of the sort panel. The default order will be applied by default to everyone in the team.
Setting a default order on a Run sets it for all Runs of the same Run Configuration.
If no default order is set, the Manual sort order is chosen.

</Aside>

## Working with Milestones

### Milestone Icons

Cards with Milestones will show a small Milestone diamond icon. Hover over the icon to see more information about the current completion progress and the due date.

<Aside>

**How are the remaining days calculated?**

A lot of UI elements referring to Milestones show you the amount of remaining days. This countdown assumes that the Milestone is due at the beginning of that day. It also uses workdays for calculating the dates. You can change your workdays within your organization settings.

</Aside>

Future Milestones will be filled, whereas past Milestones will only have an outline.

<Adventure>

You arrive in the mines. This must be source of the vast wealth of the Card Witch. A big M is spraypainted in neon green. There are other passageways leading into the dark… will you go [explore in the darkness](/hero-cards/) of the tunnels or gather as many diamonds you can carry and [head back](/workflow/) with your treasure safely tucked away?

</Adventure>

### Pinned Milestone

The top bar of the Milestone inspector includes a pin icon 📌. Pinning a Milestone allows you to quickly move cards between it and your hand without having to leave the hand view.



# Hero Cards and Journeys

## Hero Cards

![Hero Card Example](./images/hero-cards/intro.png)

Hero Cards allow you to bundle up related Cards. They are an abstraction layer living between Decks and Card checklists. If you use agile terminology, you might think of them as **Epics**. In Codecks there is more to them. In combination with Journeys they allow you to construct awesome repeatable asset pipelines.

**Before using Hero Cards you should make sure that they are enabled in your organization settings.**

<Aside>
  In teams a single asset or feature might go through the hands of many specialized team members.
  While everybody is focusing on their sub task, it can be hard to maintain an overview of the
  overall goal. Hero Cards are here to the rescue. They allow to bundle up big goal Cards and their
  related Sub Cards. Each of the contained Cards maintains full support for properties and workflow
  states.
</Aside>

### Creating Hero Cards

Hero Cards contain one or more Sub Cards. There are various ways of creating or editing Hero Cards:

- Drag and drop a Card onto an opened Card to add a Sub Card to the opened Card (which will become a Hero Card unless it already is).
- Attach an existing Card using the hero sidebar (click the hero button to the right side of opened Cards).
- From the hero sidebar you can also create a new Card inline and attach it as Sub Card immediately.
- Use the hero sidebar to select the new Hero Card of a Card.
- Select one or more Cards and use the bulk action bar to set the Hero Card or to create a new Hero Card.
- [Sort](/sorting/) your view by Hero Card and drag the Cards into the Hero Card's lane

Each Sub Card can only be part of one Hero Card. Hero Cards may not be part of other Hero Cards.

### Working with Hero Cards

Hero Cards are recognizable by the golden color. Their own workflow states are disabled, their effort is calculated by adding up the efforts of contained Sub Cards. They can have a priority or be assigned to a [Run](/runs/) or [Milestone](/milestones/).

To get a quick overview for the contained Sub Cards hover over the progress bar of the Hero Card. The progress bar will fill up as more Cards are set to done. Cards that are in progress, in review or blocked are shown by the respective colors.

![Open Hero Card with Sub Cards sidebar](./images/hero-cards/sidepanel.png)

You can see the full list of contained Sub Cards and jump between them by opening the hero sidebar. To open the sidebar you can click on the header bar of Hero Cards or click on the hero icon next to opened Cards or use the `s` shortcut.

The sub list shows all contained Cards including their title, owner, priority, effort, Run and Milestone. You may remove any Sub Card from a Hero Card again by clicking the small `X` on the Sub Card entry. Use drag and drop to change their order.

There's a filter and order button to make handling larger lists of Sub Cards easier. `ctrl/cmd + click` on a group header will open the group while closing all others.

For more interaction opportunities, you can click the magnifying glass on top of the list to get a view of all Sub Cards in their regular Card size. You can also use the action bulk bar from here, for example to assign an owner to multiple Sub Cards in one step.

Sub Cards are fully functioning Codecks Cards that have access to all the workflow and conversation features as before. This for example allows to separate the sub tasks of a bigger feature into different Runs and to different owners.

### Filtering Sub Cards

Whenever you're viewing a Deck, Run or Milestone that contains Hero Cards and Sub Cards, you can find an additional hero filter button on the header bar. The filter enables showing/hiding Sub Cards that are contained in Hero Cards currently part of the same view.

<Adventure>

What a strange feeling. At one moment you where somewhere else, but suddenly you find yourself in a small, simple room. In front of you is a wooden table. And on that table you see it. The golden Hero Card. The only Card that can best the Card Witch. Only one thing left to do. [Enter the lair of the Card Witch](/api/) and steal her treasure!

</Adventure>

## Journeys

Journeys are an awesome way for working with Hero Cards. They allow you to template full sequences of Sub Cards and to activate them with one mouse click.

### Preparing Journeys

![Journey Panel](./images/hero-cards/journey.png)

Journeys are always associated with Decks. To prepare a Journey, open a Deck and click on the Journey button on the Deck header bar. This will open the Journey setup page containing two types of Cards to manage:

- **Template Card:** when a Card is created within this Deck, the Template Card's content and properties will be applied. Use it for a Card text with bug reporting guidelines or a checklist for new team members onboarding or to apply a default tag or default owner for all Cards in a certain Deck.
- **Journey Step:** Whenever somebody clicks on the Journey icon on a Card within this Deck, the Card becomes a Hero Card containing a list of Sub Cards that mirrors the step Cards that have been set up for this Deck.

All these features combined work towards allowing for a unique asset pipeline system.

<Aside>

Let's look at an example: in your game Ghost Companion the player can befriend various ghosts inside a mansion. Each ghost has their own personality and comes from a different epoch. A reasonable start Card template might:

- Contain some sample text as a helping guideline for adding new ghost ideas
- Is assigned to Bayani the creative director of the game

Whenever your team takes a ghost character from conception to implementation it always goes through the following steps:

- Mohamed adds it to level and designs an encounter
- Samanta creates a 3D Mesh and animates it
- Barb adds some dialogue lines
- Phil adds some custom sound effects and special effects

If we take these tasks and model them as Steps in the Journey, we can build a strong workflow. Managing the production pipeline for a new ghost character is now as simple as creating a Card in the ghost character Deck and clicking the Journey button to create a full hero's journey that covers everything from start to finish.

Codecks creates all the Cards for you, which saves you time but also enables you to create a repeatable process which you can optimize as you learn more. There is another advantage to this approach: it nudges you towards a hierarchy built around thematic ideas. That makes it really easy to at any point look at your asset Decks and get a visual overview of the state of all planned assets for your game.

This works especially well if you do not put the Sub Cards the same Deck as the Hero Card but set them up to go into department/skill specific Decks. Here they can be easily found by other team members. That gives you the best of both worlds: a nice overview of your assets and also clear task Cards which are easy to assign to team members.

</Aside>

![Journey Button](./images/hero-cards/start-journey.png)

Once you are ready to start a Journey, open the Card that you want to attach the pipeline to. Hit the "Journey" button towards the bottom to open the "Start Journey" view.

![Sart Journey View](./images/hero-cards/start-journey-modal.png)

This allows you to view and alter the Cards that will be created. Clicking the Journey button a second time will show you which cards have been applied to allow you to add missing Steps.

There are no restrictions in regards to what you can do with the Sub Cards afterwards. Edit, add or remove Sub Cards as it makes sense to this particular Hero Card. Changes to Journey Steps don't affect Hero Cards that were already created using that Journey.

### Zones for Journey Steps

For more complex setups Codecks offers to organize your Steps into Zones. They work just like Card Zones when using the [manual order](/sorting/#manual-order-and-zones).

This could be used to separate e.g. mandatory from optional tasks or to allow model separate Journeys within the same Deck.

When starting a Journey, you can then select or de-select the relevant Steps to just create the Sub Cards you need.

### Dependencies for Journey Steps

Check the [Dependencies Chapter](/dependencies/#journey-dependencies) to learn how to use dependencies within Journeys.

## Project Structure

See this video for our best practice tips for how to build your projects around Journeys.

# Vision Board

![Vision Board](./images/vision-board/intro.png)

We're introducing one of the biggest new features in Codecks history: Vision Boards. While other tabs help you manage short-term tasks ([Hand](/hand/)), your complete backlog ([Decks](/decks/)), and mid-term planning ([Timeline](/milestones/)), the Vision Board gives you the ultimate high-level, "bird's-eye view" of your entire project.

Vision Boards are our interpretation of whiteboards, designed to bridge the gap between freeform ideation and structured project management. You can use them for quick brainstorming, creating mood boards, or crafting detailed documentation. But their real power lies in their ability to connect with your live project data, allowing you to build powerful dashboards.

<Aside>

This feature has been a fan favorite since we first mentioned it. To ensure we get it exactly right, we're releasing it as a **beta**.

To get started, opt-in via the feature section in the organization settings. You can then create a new Vision Board on any opened Card using the telescope button at the top right. We're excited to build this feature with your input!

![Vision Boards in Organization Settings](./images/vision-board/enable-vision-board.png)

</Aside>

## Scope

Vision Boards are attached to individual [Cards](/doc-Cards/). This means access rules for a Vision Board are inherited from its underlying card. For instance, a Vision Board on a private [Ghost Card](/hand/#ghost-Cards) can only be seen by you, and project access restrictions apply as well.

![Vision Board Button on Card](./images/vision-board/button-on-card.png)

For more organization-wide Vision Boards, you can use the [bookmark](/hand/#bookmarks) feature on the underlying card or create a dedicated [Deck](/decks/) for Cards that hold important Vision Boards.

You can navigate all available Vision Boards via the Vision Board picker at the top left of the screen. The picker shows the last board you opened and provides a list of all others you have access to, named after the titles of their underlying Cards. To open the card itself, simply click on the card icon next to the Vision Board picker. The Vision Board tab in the main header will always take you to the last board you had open.

## Whiteboard Functionality

At its core, the Vision Board is an infinite canvas for your ideas. You and your team can collaborate in real-time to work with the following nodes:

### Node Types

![Node List](./images/vision-board/node-list.png)

#### Text Node

You can use this for anything from small labels to rich, detailed documents. It supports full [Markdown formatting](/text-editor/), including Codecks-specific extensions like referencing [Cards](/doc-Cards/) with `$` , [decks](/decks/) with `$$` , and [users](/users/) with `@`.

#### Image Node

This node allows you to upload an image directly to the Vision Board. For a faster workflow, you may also paste an image from your clipboard or drop a file straight onto the canvas to add it. Image nodes can also have a text label.

#### Card Node

You can either search for any existing Card and add it to the Vision Board, or create a new one. Cards can be displayed in two modes: the default "Card" view, which shows a mini-card, or a more compact "Lane" mode. Clicking on a Card node allows you to inspect and modify it directly from the board.

#### Smart Card Node

This is a **Pro** feature that lets you create dynamic, data-driven widgets. You can set up a filter to populate the node in two ways:

- Write a query to find Cards based on specific criteria, such as "all Cards with high priority in Deck X," "all Cards assigned to User Y," or "all Sub Cards of Hero Card Z."
- Manually add specific Cards to the node by using the plus button on the search results.

Once the Cards are defined, you can visualize them using two view types:

- **Progress Charts:** These charts use [effort](/effort/) as their basis (a configurable fallback effort is used for Cards without one). Available chart types include Horizontal Bar, Vertical Bar, Pie Chart, and a Progress Bar that breaks down Cards by their [workflow state](/workflow/) (Not Started, Started, Snoozing, Blocked, Review, Done).
- **Table View:** This displays all matching Cards in a table. You can customize the table to show columns for [priority](/priority/), [effort](/effort/), [owner](/owner/), [Run](/runs/), [milestone](/milestones/), [checklist progress](/text-editor/#checklists), and [deck](/decks/).

Smart Card Nodes can have a label, which is automatically generated based on the filter you select.

#### Container Node

Containers allow you to visually and logically group other nodes. They can even be nested, with sub-containers inside parent containers. Any node that is fully enclosed within a container's boundaries will automatically belong to it, so resizing or moving a container will "capture" other nodes. The easiest way to add nodes to a container is to drag them directly into it. You can also select multiple nodes at once and use the context menu to create a new container around them. Containers can be given a custom label.

### Shared Functionality

- **Colors:** All nodes can be set to a default, neutral color or one of seven vibrant colors.
- **Arrows:** You can draw arrows between any nodes or containers to show relationships. Arrows can also have a color and a label.
- **Clipboard:** Standard copy and paste functions are fully supported.
- **Duplicate:** Quickly duplicate any selected node(s) with `ctrl/cmd + d`.
- **Delete:** Remove selected node(s) using `backspace`.
- **Undo/Redo:** Correct mistakes easily using the buttons on the left or with the standard `ctrl/cmd + z` (undo) and `ctrl/cmd + shift + z` or `ctrl/cmd + y` (redo) shortcuts.
- **Multiplayer:** Vision Boards are fully collaborative. You can see your teammates' cursors moving on the canvas in real-time, and any elements they have selected will also be highlighted for you. Note that changes inside a text node are not shown in real-time and only become visible once the editing user saves them.

### Adding Nodes

You can add new nodes to the canvas in several ways:

- Click any of the node-type buttons on the toolbar to the left of the screen.
- Double-click anywhere on an empty part of the canvas.
- Draw an arrow from an existing node into an empty section of the canvas.

### Navigating on the Canvas

- **Touchpad:** Use a two-finger scroll to pan the canvas. Pinch to zoom.
- **Mouse:** Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Right or middle click and drag to pan the canvas.
- **Keyboard + Mouse:** Hold `space` and left-click and drag to pan.
- **Zoom Controls:** You can manage and reset the zoom level using the controls at the bottom right of the screen.



# Dependencies

Dependencies allow you to track important relations between cards.

To enable the Dependencies feature, access the Mission Control by clicking on the joystick icon 🕹️ in the top left corner of the Codecks website, select _Organization Settings_ button. You will find the Dependencies setting under the _Features_ tab.

<Aside>
  Dependencies are a **Pro** feature. To use them in your organization you need to be on a paid
  Pro/Enterprise plan or be using the free educational plan.
</Aside>

<Youtube id="gd4jFXWAQec" />

## Accessing Dependencies

![Accessing Dependencies](./images/dependencies/1-accessing-dependencies.png)

Once the feature is enabled, any open non-private card will show the gate icon at the bottom right area.

Next to the gate icon which designates dependencies you will find two card numbers, the left showing the number of incoming dependencies (locked-by cards) and the right showing the number of outgoing dependencies (locking card). The strip under each of these numbers is colored by the card workflow states of the representative cards (e.g. green if already done).

Hovering over the dependencies area will show the dependency inspector which lists more details about the individual cards. You can toggle the inspector by clicking on the dependency area on the opened card. Toggling the inspector will make it remain open so you can click on any of the dependency cards to open it.

If a card is locked by dependencies, the mini card will also have a dependency icon. Hovering over the icon will also open the inspector, allowing you to see the dependent cards at a glance.

<Adventure>

You enter the card factory. After a while wandering through its dark floors, you notice: There are no more goblins here, just men made of iron, printing and cutting cards with blades sharp as razors. On their backs you see letters forming the words “Maschinen-Mensch”...curious! One of them has the letter W spraypainted on the side in bright pink. At the end of the factory floor you see a door with a diamond sign. You think there are two distinct possibilities here. You could run towards the door as quickly as you can. These dim witted machine men [will not catch you](/sorting/)! Or you could [sneak through the factory floor](/milestones/) as quietly as you can. These machine men will fail to see you.

</Adventure>

## Adding Dependencies

![How to add Dependencies](./images/dependencies/2-adding-dependencies.png)

To add a dependency toggle the dependency inspector on an open card and choose one of the two buttons in the top right of the inspector. You can..

- Add a locked-by card (a card which should be done before this card should be started)
- Add a locking card (a card that will be unlocked by setting this card to done)

A card may have multiple incoming or outgoing dependencies.

## Working on Dependency Cards

![Dialog showing that card is locked](./images/dependencies/3-working-on-dependency-cards.png)

If a card has undone incoming dependencies, clicking to [start](/workflow/) work on the card will cause a warning box to appear that will let you know that the card still has unfilled requirements. You may choose to ignore the warning (_if you are a rebel game dev that takes commands from now one, not even Codecks_) or abort the action and let the card remain in the unstarted state.

If a card becomes available for work because all its incoming dependencies (locked-by cards) are set to done, the owner of the now available card gets a notification letting them know that their card is ready for action. This is especially useful when the person working on the follow-up card is a different person than the one that worked on the prerequisite cards.

## Journey Dependencies

![Dialog showing that card is locked](./images/dependencies/4-journey-dependencies.png)

You may also add dependencies to cards in [journeys](/hero-cards/). Open the journey setup screen and add dependencies like you would for any other card. These dependencies will be applied to the newly created sub cards once the journey is triggered.

To quickly setup complex dependency chains inside of journeys, select multiple cards and use the _Dependency Chain_ bulk action (it has a gate icon) to add a full chain of dependencies with one click. The dependency chain will be applied to the selected cards and in the order in which they are appearing inside of the journey screen.

For example if you have a journey with cards A-B-C-D-E-F and you select the cards B-C-E and trigger the chain bulk action it will add..

- The dependency B->C
- The dependency C->E



# Due Dates

Due dates allow you to associate a card with a specific date. Non-done cards with pending due dates will be highlighted and create a notification for the card owner on the due date itself (based on their time zone).

<Aside>
  Due dates are a **Pro** feature. To use them in your organization you need to be on paid plan or
  be using the free educational plan. Ensure that the "Milestones & Due Dates" feature is enabled
  for your organization to be able to use this feature.
</Aside>

<Youtube id="w2kJUPCCOwM" />

### Assign a Due date to a card

![Set due date](./images/due-dates/due-dates-create.png)

Due dates can be assigned both when creating a new card and when editing an existing card. The field can be found in the property panel below the Milestone section. Use the **Pick** button open the date picker to add a due date for this card.

Note that a card can have both a milestone and a due date associated with it. To remove a due date, use the **None** button at the top right.

![Set due date via bulk selection](./images/due-dates/due-dates-multi-create.png)

You can also assign a a due date to multiple cards at once. Select the cards and look for the bell icon with the selection actions.

<Adventure>

You can hardly believe it. It is right in front of you. The treasure of the Card Lich… her set of magical playing cards. You rifle through them. There is lots of text on the cards, and images, some of them move. Incredible. So these must be the magical cards that allowed that sorceress to construct this awesome dungeon on time and under budget. You pocket the cards and prepare to leave. With these cards, there is no saying what magnificent thing you will do next. The end.

</Adventure>

### Overview of your and your team's Due dates

![Due dates in the hand](./images/due-dates/due-dates-hand.png)

The [Hand tab](/hand/) contains a section called `Your due cards`. The color indicates the state of the most due cards whereas the number indicates how many cards are in that state:

- **Red:** This card is due today or already overdue
- **Yellow:** This card is due within the next 5 workdays

Note that this color pattern is also applied for the bell icon at the bottom left of the mini card.

Opening that tab shows up to three groups: `Due now`, `Due soon` (again, due within 5 workdays) and `Due later`.

Clicking the `Show all` button at the very right of the panel allows you to inspect all due dates of the team no matter who this card is assigned to.

### Due dates in the Timeline

![Due dates in the timeline](./images/due-dates/due-dates-timeline.png)

You can find the Timeline by opening the "Timeline" tab at the very top. Every due card that is assigned to you will create an entry in the timeline via the bell icon. You can click the bell icon to open an inspector showing all your due cards for that day.

<Aside>

### When to pick Due dates vs Milestones?

As both feature associate a card with a date, there might be confusion for when to use one feature over the other. So here's a handy overview:

**When to prefer Due dates:**

- To help you remind you of one-off dates (scheduled meetings, deadlines set by third parties, preparations for releases)
- When there's a clear owner (non-assigned cards won't generate any notifications)
- It only affects very few cards on a given date

**When to prefer Milestones:**

- If multiple cards are affected (e.g for a release)
- If it's not clear yet who is responsible for a task

</Aside>

### Notifications

![Notification for a due card](./images/due-dates/due-dates-notifications.png)

If these conditions are met for a card, a notification is created for you at the beginning of the day (based on the timezone of your browser):

- Card is due for today
- Card is assigned to you
- Card is not done
- Card is not archived

To remove the notification you need to change one of these properties above as you cannot directly dismiss the notification.

Advanced
===================


# Quick Settings

![Quick Setting Overlay](./images/quick-settings/intro.png)

The Quick Settings Panel allows to change a card's main properties from various places. It can be controlled exclusively by the keyboard, allowing mouse-free interactions.

## How to open the Quick Settings

The Quick Settings Panel can be summoned in various ways:

1. Via clicking the Effort Icon on the Mini Card or an opened Card
2. Via a slash command while editing a card's content. It's the first slash command, so activating can be done by hitting `/` followed by `Enter`.
3. On an opened Card you can use any of the property shortcuts (`p`, `e`, `o`, `m`, `,`) to invoke the Quick Settings panel already opened with the respective sections.

## How to operate the Quick Settings

The following properties can be changed:

- Deck
- [Owner](/owner/)
- [Runs](/runs/)
- [Milestones](/milestones/)
- [Priority](/priority/)
- [Effort](/effort/)

Note that a decks's project has an impact on which owners, Runs or Milestones are available.

While mouse operations work as expected, the overlay is meant to be operated by the keyboard. You can use the up and down arrow keys to select amongst the options for the current property. Use the left and right arrow keys for switching between properties. You can filter the shown options if you start typing.

When navigating by Keyboard changes are not stored immediately but only once the overlay is closed by hitting `Enter`. Pending property changes are marked with a dot next their icon. To abort, you can hit `Esc`, or click outside of the overlay.



# Activity

![Activity View](./images/activity/activity-view.png)

### Where to find it?

There are four contexts in which an activity feed can be found:

1. **[The Hand](/hand/):** this allows to show a feed on a user basis. By default it shows your updates, but the select box at the top allows to change to different users
2. **The Deck Library:** This feed is a global one across all projects
3. **Deck:** Opens an activity feed for changes wihtin this deck
4. **[Runs](/runs/):** Opens an activity feed for changes for a given Run
5. **[Milestones](/milestones/):** Opens an activity feed for changes for a given milestone

Click the activity button to inspect all recent actions for any card within a deck or milestone or hand. Clicking on the card opens it. You can then check the specific card history for more details about that card.

Load more activity by scrolling down and clicking on 'load more'.

<Aside>

The activity stream is a great source to answer questions like:
_what progress did we make this week for this Run?_

</Aside>

### Filters

The filter section at the top of the activity screen allows you to filter the activity feed according to these criteria:

- Created cards
- [Workflow state changes](/workflow/) (e.g. card started, done or archived)
- Show only done cards
- [Adding or removing attachments](/attachments/)
- Property changes (i.e. [priority](/priority/), [effort](/effort/), [owner](/owner/), [run](/runs/), [milestone](/milestones/), [due date](/due-dates/) )
- Content changes
- Created comments

<Adventure>

The bespectacled goblin leads you through a tour of the library. “And here, you can see the works of our leader, the Card Witch.” He shows you pictures of the witch building the magical mountain; digging for diamonds in the mines; constructing a strange machine. “And this concludes our tour”, the goblin points to a brighlty lit door: “Please, [exit through the gift shop](/owner/).” However, you also see another passage, the door conveniently left open. Do you go through that [other door](/conversations/)?

</Adventure>



# Time Tracking

<Aside>
  Time tracking is a **Pro** feature. To use it in your organization you need to be on a paid
  Pro/Enterprise plan or be using the free educational plan.
</Aside>

Time Tracking can be enabled via `Organization Settings > Features`. You can pick between two modes:

- Manual
- Real-time and Manual

If time tracking is disabled, no exisiting time tracking information will be lost.

## Manual Time Tracking

In this mode the History side panel of an open Card contains an _Add Time_ button which allows to enter and edit time tracking information. Using the button, you may enter time spent and choose the date and time on which this work happened. The entered time tracking data is always associated with your user account.

![Manual Entry Form](./images/time-tracking/manual-form.png)

<Aside>
  This form can be quickly opened by hitting `cmd/ctrl + t` or by `cmd/ctrl + click` on the clock
  icon on the card header shown below.
</Aside>

The history panel also shows previously tracked time. You can correct the tracked time by using the plus/minus buttons next to the time entry to add or remove time in 5 minutes steps (\*spent too long at the coffee machine?).
You can also click on the time entry itself for an input field offering more extensive editing. You can delete the full time tracking entry by clicking the trash icon next to it.

At the top of the Card history panel you'll find a _Total tracked time_ entry summing up all time entries on this Card sorted by owner. There is also a small clock icon at the bottom of each Card containing time information. Hovering over it will allow you to check the total amount of time spent at a glance.

The clock icon contains a colored fill that grows as more time is tracked. The filled area increases exponentially with the total time spent on the card, meaning it provides a quick visual intuition for comparing relative time spent between cards, but the relationship isn't linear (e.g., a half-filled icon doesn't necessarily mean twice the time of a quarter-filled icon). The area approaches being full asymptotically, meaning it would only theoretically reach 100% fill with infinite time spent.

You can also use time tracking information to sort cards. This is a good way for quickly identifying expensive tasks in your Run, Milestone or Deck view.

<Adventure>

You enter a vast hall illuminated by tiny blinking lights overhead in the rock itself. A machine consisting of spinning rings is creating a sphere. The sphere looks strange, as if it was made of liquid metal. Busy goblins in white aprons and with large lenses strapped to their faces pull levers, dial knobs and argue animatedly amongst themselves! They seem to be very busy and it would be wise to leave them to their work and [go through the giant door labeled exit](/workflow/). But something about the sphere seems interesting. You could [jump into the sphere](/effort/) when these goblin nerds aren’t looking.

</Adventure>

## Real-time tracking

Enabling real-time tracking, includes all features described above for manual time tracking. In addition, you'll find a clock icon at the top bar of each Card to start, stop and inspect the timer.

![Running Tracker for two people on a Card](./images/time-tracking/time-tracking-button.png)

There's two convenient automations for starting and stop the timer:

- Once you start working on a Card by hitting the play button (i.e. once you turn it blue), the time tracker will automatically be started for you.
- If a Card gets marked as done or gets archived, all running timers will be stopped.

Here's some rules around time tracking:

- A single user can only have a single timer running.
- The timer can started on any type of card by any amount of people. This could be useful for e.g. meetings that can be represensented via meeting cards.

Enabling real-time tracking also gives you a handy widget in the bottom left, which highlights your current task and the time spent so far. You can quickly adjust the time spent by using the plus/minus buttons. You can also stop the timer by pressing the stop button on the widget.

In addition the web site title will change so that you can scan the time spent on your browser tab. In case you forget to stop the Card timer you can always manually edit the Card history to fix up the time. In your organization settings you will also find a field to edit the amount of time after which a Card time tracker will stop automatically due to suspiciously effective work segments. If the tracker was automatically stopped, you'll receive a notication and the widget of the bottom will have turned into a snoozing purple color.

A Card's history panel also highlights these entries with a snoozing icons until the time entries have been adapted.

<Aside>

#### Started Worflow State vs Running Timer

In previous versions of Codecks, the blue started state and a running timer were tied to each other.

In December 2024 we've decoupled thes two states to allow for more flexible use cases, like having multiple people track on a single card, or track time on reviews.

This also means that now multiple cards could be marked as _started_ for a single person. We believe this is a good change to highlight potential process issues if a single person (or the whole team) have started a lot of cards without ever going to the next stage of a review or marking them as done.

</Aside>

## Time Tracking Report

You can access the time tracking report via the mission control (open by clicking on the joystick in the top left). The report contains a detailed list of all time tracked by all team members.

You can sort by:

- Start Date / Time
- Duration
- User
- Card
- Project

To filter the table use the filter icons next to the individual table columns to show/hide individual entries. You can filter by date, user and project.
At the bottom left you can see the total time tracked in Codecks.

You can export all information for your current filter in CSV format by clicking the export button in the bottom right.

# User Management & Permissions

## Roles

Codecks differentiates between **org-wide roles** and **project-specific** roles.

Here's a high-level overview of org-wide roles:

- #### `Owner`

  Assigned to the creator of an organization. There may only be one owner.

- #### `Admin`

  Have access to all projects and can manage billing and integrations.

- #### `Staff`

  May access assigned projects only. Can be assigned the project-specific `Producer` role.

- #### `Observer`
  May access assigned projects only. They can't change any data but may add comments to cards.

Users with the `Staff` role may be given the project-specific `Producer` role. A producer can manage Decks, Runs, Milestones and integrations for the project. The producer role is available to organizations with the `Pro` plan.

<Adventure>

You are in a room with an ancient snoring goblin wearing an eye patch. With a gasp he comes awake! He introduces himself as the old partner of the Card Witch. “When she turned into the Card Lich, she abandonend me here. Oh, why did we have to try and outrun the Time Pirates.” The ancient goblin wants you to help him fix everything. He himself is too old. But you could go into the time machine. He could show you, just would just have to [follow him](/time-tracking/). Or you could just [slowly back out of this room](/attachments/) away from the old goblin and his strange tales.

</Adventure>

## Project Visibility

`Admins` and `Owners` have access to all projects. Projects have a visibility setting which determines if all `Staff` members can access a project or whether they need to be explicitely added. `Observers` always have to be explicitely added, no matter the project visibility setting.

`Limited` Project Visibilty is available in the `Pro` plan.

![Project creation with project visibility option](./images/users/project-visibility.png)

<Aside>

It often makes sense to create multiple Codecks projects for a single game. This allows you to share different parts of the game project management with different collaborators. See this [blog post](https://www.codecks.io/blog/2021/game-production-case-study-maschinen-mensch/) for an example of how to use to a private CEO project.

</Aside>

## Permissions

### `Limited` vs `Full` Staff Permissions

`Admins` and `Owners` can set Staff Permissions with the **User Management** screen. `Full` Staff Permissions allows all Staff members to

- Create and manage Decks
- Create and manage project-specific Runs and Milestones
- Manage global Runs and Milestones
- Manage Journeys
- Manage Project Tags

in the projects they have access to.

### Permission Matrix

The list below shows the minimum role that has permission to perform or access the corresponding actions.

Here's the full hierarchy to know what a minum role implies:
`Owner > Admin > Producer > Staff > Observer`

This means that if a `Producer` is allowed to perform a certain action, then the `Owner` and `Admins` are also allowed to do it.

Entries marked with `Staff*` imply that `Staff Permissions` are set to `Full`. Otherwise these actions are only available to `Producers`.

#### Organization-based Permissions

| Action                                     | Minimum Role |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Can view user overview                     | `Observer`   |
| Can manage integrations <sup>1</sup>       | `Producer`   |
| Can manage billing                         | `Admin`      |
| Can invite users                           | `Admin`      |

| Can assign different Owner                 | `Owner`      |

<sup>1</sup> `Producers` will be able to access all integrations. But project or deck names they don't
have access to won't be shown. They may only pick target decks from projects they are producer of.

#### Project-based Permissions

| Action                                                     | Minimum Role          |

| Can change default access for `Staff` and `Observers`      | `Admin`               |

#### Run-based Permissions

| Action                                      | Minimum Role          |

## Invite Users

If you open the Mission Control via the Joystick icon at the top left, you'll find the `User Management` section. This contains an overview of the current users as well as two options for inviting new members to your organization if you are an admin or owner.

### Invite via E-Mail

This option allows to invite users on a one-by-one basis by entering their email. This will sent a message to the entered email containing a link that allows to join your invitations. This option allows to define the user's role as well as which project access this user should get.

### Invite via Link

If you want to invite multiple team members in one go, you can generate an invite link. This will allow anyone who has access to it to join your organization. The person creating the link will receive a confirmation email for each person joining. The invited people will join as staff members with the default project accessiblity rights.
You can disable this link anytime by pressing the "Disable Link" button.



# History

The card history side panel is the central hub for seeing all card changes that ever happened to a card. It also contains additional tools to manage card notifications. Access it by clicking the history button to the right side of an opened card.

## Timeline

![Timeline of a card](<./images/history/1 Timeline.png>)

The history panel contains a timeline listing in detail all the changes to a card, including changes to:

- Text
- Priority
- Effort
- Text
- Checklists
- Sub Cards
- Attachments
- Runs
- Milestones
- Tags
- Workflow state
- Conversations

If you are using time tracking, it also contains time tracking related entries as well as a time tracking summary at the top.

You can use the filters at the top to focus on specific kind of entries.

<Adventure>

You find yourself in a grand library. You skim through dusty books. The Card Witch, they say, is all powerful. Only the fabled Hero Card can match her powers. A small door, barely ajar, catches your eye. “Ahem”, you hear. You look around. Nothing. Then down. A small, greenish creature with a goatee and tiny glasses looks up at you. “Here for the tour of the library?”, the goblin librarian croaks. [Do you take the tour](/attachments/) or [sneak away through the small door](/activity/)?

</Adventure>

## Created by

![Time tracking and creation information for a card](<./images/history/2 Created by.png>)

You can scroll down the history timeline to find the initial card creation properties including who assigned them. For a quick glance for who created the card at what date, you may also check the dedicated _created_ table at the top.

## Watching a card

Here you can see who currently is watching the card and add or remove yourself as watcher of the card. Anyone mentioned within the card content will be watching it automatically. Watching a card means you will get notified when the workflow state changes or a conversation is started.

When creating a card, the card creator is added as a watcher of this card by default. You can disable this behavior by clicking the eye icon next to the card creation dialogue. This especially makes sense if you're creating many cards for other team members for which you don't want to receive detailed updates.



# Guardians

As your team grows it can be hard to ensure that no cards fall through the cracks within your workflow. Hunting down invalid review processes can cost time and cause confusion.

<Aside>
  Guardians are a **Pro** feature. The feature can be enabled in the header area of any opened deck.
  Look for the shield icon.
</Aside>

This is why Codecks allows to appoint Guardians for a deck. Any member of your team can become a Guardian by selecting them from the corresponding Section.

![Guardian Selection](./images/guardians/intro.png)

Once Guardians have been chosen, only them (and Producers and Admins) are able to directly mark a card of this deck as done.

Anyone else has to go through the review process. All guardians will automatically be added to a review. The review flow will be slightly altered for cards within Guardian decks.
Instead of opting out, review participants are shown the option **Approve and leave conversation**. Once all participants have approved, the card owner will be able to close the review and mark the card as done.

In addtion to the altered review flow, non-Guardians may not archive cards or move cards into a different deck.

Integrations
===================


# User Reports

User Reports allow your users to send feedback directly from within your application. Each feedback will result in a new Codecks card in the deck(s) of your choice. You can either directly talk to our API endpoint or use our ready-made Unity integration to connect to our Codecks server.

## Setup your first application

As a first step you need to open up your Organization Settings and look for the **User Reports** section. You'll get to chose between the Unity integration and creating reports via the API. Changes in either section will be reflected in the other (i.e. settings made in the **via API** section will be used in the Unity integration and vice versa).

Whichever option you've picked, you will be asked to add your first application. You need to enter the name and the target deck in which cards shall be added by default. Both options can be changed later on. Once submitted, you'll receive two keys: a **Report Token** and an **Access Key**. Let's have a look at those two.

### Report Token

Report Tokens are meant to be embedded within your application. They allow you to create a card according to the options passed to the endpoint and according to the rules you've set up in the settings. Report Tokens can be disabled to prevent more reports from coming in. This can be helpful if one token has gone "rogue". You can re-enable a disabled token anytime.

An application can have multiple Report Tokens, each with a unique label. This is meant to differentiate feedback coming from different builds.

By default, Codecks creates a Report Token with a **Default** label for you. To create new Report Tokens you need to use another API endpoint along with an `Access Key`.

### Access Key

Access Keys are more security sensitive and should not end up in your builds. They are meant to be used within your build process though. Whenever you are about to release a new version, you can use the Access Key to create a new Report Token with a version-specific label. The label will be used as a tag in generated cards and thus allows you to quickly filter and sort your reports.

An Access Key is automatically generated when adding a new application in the settings. You won't be able to see that key again within Codecks. In case you have lost it, you are able to regenerate a new one. This will invalidate the old Access Key however.

<Aside>

## Unity Plugin

![Unity Banner](./images/user-reports/unity-banner.png)

You soon will be able to install the Plugin directly from the Unity Asset Store. While the verification is still ongoing, you can go to [GitHub](https://github.com/codecks-io/codecks-unity/releases) and download the plugin there. Move the `Assets/Codecks_io/Codecks Bugs & Feedback Reporter` folder into the `Assets/Codecks Bugs & Feedback Reporter` folder of your project. Once imported, you can find a scene named `CodecksSampleScene` that contains a default layout and sample setup for you to check out. Unity will also ask to install the `TextMesh Pro` plugin. This plugin is necessary to run the sample scene.

The sample scene already provides all the UI elements and component setup for you to get started right away. You can test the initial setup of the report tool right from the sample scene by entering your created report token (the one that you created in your Codecks User Report settings screen) into the `Default Token` property of the `CodecksCardCreator` component on the `CardCreator` scene object (found under the `Canvas` object). Once you've done that you can hit _Play_. Click the "Give Feedback!" button, fill out the form and press "Send report". If everything works, you should see a card pop up in your Codecks just moments later. In case of issues, an error message should be printed to your screen and console.

After testing the initial setup, we recommend copying or integrating the sample scene into your own UI game scene where you can configure it to show up when pressing a hotkey or by selecting a menu entry according to your own needs. You may also modify the layout to fit your game thematically or use the Codecks default layout as provided. In any case please make sure to not hide the `Powered by Codecks` sprite and display it next to the report form.

Here's an explanation what the two provided MonoBehavior classes do:

- **CodecksCardCreator** handles the basic API communication with Codecks for the purpose of creating cards inside your Codecks project. This class does not handle any UI related tasks and contains only the basic functionality.
- **CodecksCardCreatorForm** is a helper class that manages the UI and forwards the input to the `CodecksCardCreator` class. You may write your own UI handling in case you're not using the default Unity Canvas system or in case you have special requirements for your UI. The class provides a method `GetMetaText` which you can edit to add your own game related meta data. By default the component also creates a screenshot and attaches it to the request sent to the `CodecksCardCreator` class. You may choose to add additional files to the request (e.g. attaching a savegame or world state dump).

</Aside>

## Codecks Settings

Here's a tour of all options available in the settings screen:

- **Report Tokens**

  ![Report Token Overview](./images/user-reports/report-token-list.png)

  This tab presents you an overview of all created Report Tokens for your application. It allows you to disable or re-enable specific tokens. Disabling a Report Token will prevent any feedback using this token from creating a card. This list also shows the token itself, label, creation date and the number of created cards.

- **Update Settings**

  ![Update Settings Screen](./images/user-reports/update-settings.png)

  This screens allows you to change these settings:

  - **Name of Application:** The name is used in the select box on the top right as well as in emails sent to feedback reporters (see below)
  - **Maximum Upload Size:** As Report Tokens are part of your builds they can theoretically be extracted and used for malicious activites. To prevent user reports from quickly filling up your storage quota, you can configure a limit here.
  - **Map Severity to Deck:** feedback reports can set a **severity** value. Each severity can be mapped to a different deck allowing e.g more severe issues to be put into a dedicated deck.
  - **Map Severity to Priority:** You can also use priority as a signal for severity.

- **New Access Key**

  In case you either lost your current Access Key or you want to invalidate it, this section allows you to create a new Access Key. Make sure to copy it somewhere safe as it won't be shown again after it has been generated.

- **Delete Application**

  This tab allows to remove the application from the User Report integration. Any Access Key or Report Token will be deleted and no more emails will be sent out to feedback reporters. Applications calling the endpoint with a deleted token will receive a `401 unauthorized` response.

### Multi-Application support

In case you're working on multiple games or apps, you can add another application to this integration. Look for the `+` icon next to the application selector in the top right of the settings screen.

## Automatic email updates to feedback reporters

When submitting feedback to Codecks, you can provide an optional `userEmail` field. This field will be used to send an email to the provided address once the associated card is set to done. Theses types of email will be sent once a day and batch all done cards for any given email address. The email will contain the name of the application as well as the current card title and a link to it. The link of the card is a smart link and has three modes:

- if the current user is a member of the organization, the smart link will open the card within the organization
- if the card is within a public open deck, the card will be opened in this context
- if neither is true, the link will render a card which only displays the title of the card.

<Adventure>

The Card Lich is no more. Victorious, you rummage through the Lich’s chamber. Soon, you find what you were after: The key to the treasure of that cursed sorceress. Now, if only you could remember where that vault was… If you don’t remember, [go the central hub](/workflow/) of the dungeon.

</Adventure>

## API

In case you want to setup your own engine integration or want to understand how the Unity plugin works exactly, we will describe how the API endpoints work exactly:

### Create a report

To create a card issue a `POST` message in the following form:

`POST https://api.codecks.io/user-report/v1/create-report?token=[REPORT_TOKEN]`

#### Body

The body of the message has to be a JSON object of this form:

```json
{
  "content": "text content of your report\n\nthe first line will be treated as the title.",
  "severity": "high",
  "fileNames": ["logs.txt", "screenshot-1.png"],
  "userEmail": "user@example.com"
}
```

Note that `severity`, `fileNames`, `userEmail` are optional. `severity` can be either `"critical"`, `"high"`, `"low"` or `null`. If a `userEmail` is provided, that user will receive an email once their report is marked as done.

#### Curl example

Here is an example of how to issue the message via `curl`:

```bash
curl 'https://api.codecks.io/user-report/v1/create-report?token=[REPORT_TOKEN]' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{"content":"report content", "fileNames": ["logs.txt"]}'
```

#### Response

The response object for this endpoint has this form:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "cardId": "[CARD_ID]",
  "uploadUrls": [
    {
      "fileName": "logs.txt",
      "url": "https://[UPLOAD_URL]",
      "fields": {
        "key1": "[VALUE1]",
        "key2": "[VALUE2]"
      }
    },
    {
      "fileName": "screenshot-1.png",
      "url": "https://[UPLOAD_URL]",
      "fields": {
        "key1": "[VALUE1]",
        "key2": "[VALUE2]"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Uploading files

You'll receive an entry in the `uploadUrls` list for each file name you specified in `fileNames`. This contains a signed URL that allows you to directly upload the files to the respective Codecks S3 bucket.

This means we're relying on [AWS Api](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-HTTPPOSTConstructPolicy.html) here which unfortunately is a bit more involved.

For each file you need to create a `POST` request to the specified `url`. The payload is _not_ JSON-based but is `multipart/form-data` encoded. We strongly encourage you to use a http library of your choice to construct the request. The `FormData` contains all the listed `fields` as well as an additional field called `file` containing the binary contents of your file and another field `Content-Type` containing the mime-type of the file (e.g. `text/plain` or `image/png`).

In case you want to go the route of constructing the multipart/form-data request yourself, here's what the body typically looks like assuming that your request defines a content-type header like this: `Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=gfLcwHS2rnS8ATXB10lG`

```
--gfLcwHS2rnS8ATXB10lG
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="key"

["key" value from uploadUrls]
--gfLcwHS2rnS8ATXB10lG
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Cache-Control"

### Create a new Report Token

To create a new report token issue a `POST` of this form:

`POST https://api.codecks.io/user-report/v1/create-report-token?accessKey=[ACCESS_KEY]`

#### Body

The body of the message has to be a JSON object of this shape:

```json
{
  "label": "string describing your version"
}
```

#### Curl example

Here is a `curl` example using this endpoint:

```bash
curl 'https://api.codecks.io/user-report/v1/create-report-token?accessKey=[ACCESS_KEY]' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{"label":"v0.2.1"}'
```

#### Response

The response is expected to be of this form:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "token": "[TOKEN]"
}
```



# Open Decks

Codecks allows you to share the contents of any of your projects publicly on the web. Visitors are be able to navigate to your public URL and see all the project cards and their contents. You can even choose to allow your visitors to upvote their favorite cards. Don't worry: your visitors won't be able to change the card content or card properties themselves.

<Aside>
Here are some ideas for how you might want to use the Open Decks feature:

- Share your public Early Access roadmap as you work towards your full release date.
- Share your list of known game bugs to get fewer redundant bug reports.
- Give your fans unique access to what you're currently working on.
- Let your community vote on what they feel most strongly about.

Ahem.. this is probably a good moment to promote our own public deck page. You can find our public ROADMAP and community feedback cards [here](https://open.codecks.io/codecks-roadmap).

</Aside>

If you want to share only some cards, but not all the cards in your project, we recommend creating two separate projects inside your organization. One for the cards that you want to share and one for the cards that you want to keep private.

## Sharing your project

To share your project go into the project settings of the project that you want to share. To access the project settings open the mission control by clicking on the joystick icon 🕹️ in the top left corner. In the sidebar hover over the project that you want to share and click on the cogwheel icon ⚙.

You will see a settings section called _Make Project Public_. Enable the toggle switch to enable sharing. Make sure to choose an URL name for your project in the text field. You can see a preview of the full URL underneath the text field.

You may even share multiple projects to different URLs.

![Setting up your Open Decks page](./images/open-decks/sharing.png)

## Open Deck Communities

Visitors to your Open Decks can join your community by clicking the button in the top right. To do so they can either use their existing Codecks user account or quickly sign up using their email or Discord login to create a visitor profile.

![Joining your Codecks community](./images/open-decks/subscribing.png)

Joining your community will allow them to upvote individual cards (if you enabled upvoting). Community members may also choose to receive email updates about your project by clicking _Get notified of updates_ in the right top corner. In that case they will be able to choose between daily or weekly updates.

## Upvote Stats

This view can be reached from the hand dashboard and shows your latest upvotes, including those from your Open Decks, your Discord community and also your own team. It also shows you how many guests are visiting your public Open Decks web site. You may also receive this information as a weekly email report by enabling the _Receive weekly report per mail_ toggle.

![Visitor Statistics for your Open Decks](./images/open-decks/visitorStats.png)

## Open Decks Gallery

The website **[open.codecks.io](https://open.codecks.io)** features an overview of some of the shared projects. It is a great way for discovering cool projects that are already using the Open Decks feature and to get inspired by how other devs are using Codecks. If you like to be listed on that page and receive potential social media shout-outs by us, enable the toggle for allowing us to feature you.

To make your project stand out on the Open Decks gallery, make sure to upload a custom promo image. This image will only be used on the gallery page. If you provide no image, we’ll try to be smart and select the image of your first cover image.

![See other projects using Codecks](./images/open-decks/openDecksGallery.png)

<Adventure>

You land on a ship. A rainstorm is pounding the deck. A weathered E is painted blue on the deck. Around you are hearty adventurers, goblins the lot of them. At the steering wheel you see a young woman with a determined look in her eyes. She holds a card in her left hand. The sea goblins are shouting. “Incoming!” A young goblin with an eyepatch shoves a sword into your hand. You now have a sword. In the distance, you see a ship approaching, its flag a dreadful hourglass. Below the ship the sea shimmers like liquid metal. Should you stay on and [help these swarthy goblins](/discord/)? Or do you take the coward’s way out and [abandon ship](/conversations/)?

</Adventure>

## Information for your audience

Make sure to provide some initial information about your project to your guests. The chosen display name of your project will be shown in the top left corner of your public page. The banner image will be shown in the center. You may also provide a message to your audience that will be shown front and center of your public page.

You may also choose to allow your users to see the comments on each shared card. Enabling this still won’t allow them to write comments themselves.

![Information for your Codecks community](./images/open-decks/information.png)

## Customizing the Card Order

When users visit your page, they’ll see all the decks contained in the public project. If they open a deck they’ll see all the contained cards. We recommend setting a default card order for your public shared decks.

To set the default card order visit the deck in the Codecks app and open the ordering options in the left sidebar. Select the order option that you want to use and click on the star icon ⭐ at the top _“Ordering”_ sidebar. Doing so will make this the sort order which guests will see when they visit your public deck.

![Setting a custom sort order for your Codecks deck](./images/open-decks/cardOrder.png)

They may still choose to change this default order to something else. To return to the default presentation order they just have to click on the _reset to default order_ icon that appears on the deck header.

For cards that require a specific order, you can also choose the _manual_ sort option and manually arrange the order by drag’n’dropping cards into the right positions.

<Aside>
  We recommend sorting your feedback decks containing Discord cards by upvotes, whereas an
  introductory deck with more instructions for your visitors might best be presented in a fixed
  manual order. Setting the default order is also something that works in your private decks by the
  way and can help your team navigate more seamless through your decks.
</Aside>

## Quick URLs

If you have enabled sharing your project, you’ll notice globe icons 🌍 appear in various places around your shared deck. These are quick links for jumping to the public page of that specific content. You’ll notice these..

- next to your project in the mission control sidebar
- on the deck header of each public deck
- on the top of each card that is inside a public deck

Clicking on the project or deck quick links will open the public URL for that context. Clicking on the globe icon on a card will copy the URL to your clipboard. These are great for sharing links to specific content with your audience.

![Quickly get the URL to your open deck](./images/open-decks/quickURLs.png)



# Quick Guide to Codecks API

_Version: Aug 2023 (beta)_

<Aside>
  Open the [API Reference](/api-reference/) for a full overview of the models, their fields and
  their relations.
</Aside>

The Codecks API is the source for powering the web app, so expect it to be fairly stable and expansive. We can't yet make any guarantees regarding the stability of all schema definitions and endpoints at this point. So tread with care!

To get started you need to extract your access token. **This token will allow anyone who holds it to impersonate you**. This also means they have access to all the same Organizations and contents as you do via the web app. So be careful who you share it with. You might want to create an observer user and use their token if this helps your use case (and the observer limitations suit your use case) you might also create a new non-observer user but this will count towards your user quota.

To extract the token, check requests going to the codecks api (https://api.codecks.io). There you'll find a cookie called `at` containing your token.

> Note: we've changed the token handling in January 2021, if your login session is older than that you need to logout and login again to find this cookie.

<Aside>
  Visit our [Community Hub](https://www.codecks.io/community/) to see examples of how to integrate
  with Codecks.
</Aside>

## Reading Data

This token and the subdomain of your organization should be all you need to do our first request:

```bash
curl 'https://api.codecks.io/' \
  -H 'X-Account: [SUBDOMAIN]' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Auth-Token: [TOKEN]' \
  --data-binary '{"query":{"_root":[{"account":["name"]}]}}'
```

(if your organization is on `team123.codecks.io` the `[SUBDOMAIN]` value should be `team123`)

This should return the name of your organization (= `account`). Note that there is only this single endpoint for getting information. Use the `"query"` portion to create a nested graphql-like request to get whatever data however deeply nested is required.

I won't go into all details but here's some helpful queries to give you an idea of whats possible:

**return all cards with their titles within your account (aka organization)**

```json
{"_root": [{"account": [{"cards": ["title"]}]}]}
```

**return all cards with their title whose title contains `[SEARCHTERM]`**

```json
{
  "_root": [
    {
      "account": [
        {"cards({\"title\":{\"op\":\"contains\",\"value\":\"[SEARCHTERM]\"}})": ["title"]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**return 10 cards from deck `123` ordered by creation date**

```json
{"_root":[
  {"account":[{"cards({"deckId": 123, "$order": "createdAt", "$limit": 10})":["title"]}]}
]}
```

**equivalent to:**

```json
{"deck(123)":{
  "cards({"$order": "createdAt", "$limit": 10})":["title"]
}}
```

**return all cards with an effort &gt; 5 or effort &lt;= 1**

```json
{"_root":[
  {"account":[{"cards(
    {\"$or\": [
      {\"effort\": {\"op\": \"gt\", \"value\": 5}},
      {\"effort\": {\"op\": \"lte\", \"value\": 1}}
    ]}
  )":["title"]}]
}
```

to get more ideas of what's doable, check the "network" tab in your browser dev tools and see which queries are triggered when opening a specific part of the app.

## Writing data

Again, I won't provide a full reference of available actions. The most helpful thing would be to perform the desired action in the web app and use the network tab in your dev tools to check which `/dispatch/` endpoint was triggered.

Here's an example for creating a card:

```bash
curl 'https://api.codecks.io/dispatch/cards/create' \
  -H 'X-Auth-Token: [TOKEN]' \
  -H 'X-Account: [SUBDOMAIN]' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{"assigneeId":null,"content":"My card content","putOnHand":true,"deckId":null,"milestoneId":null,"masterTags":[],"attachments":[],"effort":12,"priority":"b","childCards":[],"userId":"[YOUR-USER-ID]"}'
```

This would create a card on your hand and return the id.

## Restrictions

A single IP may perform 40 requests every 5 seconds before being rate-limted.

## Example Snippets

Do you have a script or snippet you'd like to share? Feel free to get [in touch with us](mailto:hello@codecks.io)!

#### Add file to card (python)

```py
import os
import requests
import mimetypes


def add_file_to_card(filepath, card_id, user_id, subdomain, token):
    content_type = mimetypes.guess_type(filepath)[0]
    file_size = os.path.getsize(filepath)
    filename = os.path.basename(filepath)

    headers = {
        'X-Account': subdomain,
        'X-Auth-Token': token,
    }

    # request s3 upload details
    response = requests.get("https://api.codecks.io/s3/sign?objectName=%s" % filename, headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()
    u = response.json()

    # upload file
    files = [('file', (filename, open(filepath, 'rb'), content_type))]
    payload = u['fields']
    payload["Content-Type"] = content_type
    requests.request("POST", u['signedUrl'], headers=headers, data=payload, files=files)

    # update card
    requests.request("POST", "https://api.codecks.io/dispatch/cards/addFile", headers=headers, json={
        "cardId": card_id,
        "userId": user_id,
        "fileData": {
            "fileName": filename,
            "url": u['publicUrl'],
            "size": file_size,
            "type": content_type,
        }
    })
```

<Adventure>

You find yourself face to face with what has once been the Card Witch. Her human face is sunken. A blueish light, magical in origin, pulses beneath her skin. Her yellow eyes are full of anger. She is a Witch no more. This is a Lich. “How did you make it past my goblins, adventurer? You will regret coming here…” She is readying her spell. If you came unprepared you can [run at her](/text-editor/) and hope for the best. However, if you have found the way to defeat the Lich, you can smile to yourself and ready the card that will [best the master of this dungeon](/user-reports/).

</Adventure>



# Importers

Codecks offers two types of Importers. A generic CSV importer as well as importers for specific services (Trello and HacknPlan at the moment).

## CSV Importer

The CSV Importer is the most flexible solution and comes with smart heuristics to make the experience as smooth as possible.

You can find it towards the bottom of the Organzation Settings. You start the flow by picking or dragging a csv file into file picker.

![CSV Importer](./images/import/csv-1.png)

<Aside>

### What properties can be imported?

- **Title & Content:** if only **Content** is passed, the first line will be turned into the card's title.
- **Owner:** Will make a best guess based on user name, full name and email-address of users on Codecks.
- **Effort:** Allows to specify a factor to turn any number into an effort.
- **Priority:** Allows to map any value into one of the 3 priority levels or `None`.
- **Status:** Allows to map any value to `Default`, `Started`, `Done`, `Doc Card` or `Archived`. `Default` will become either `Unassigned` or `Assigned` depending on whether a Owner is present.

</Aside>

Once imported you can go through each of the card properties above and decide which column in your CSV should be considered. Based on some heuristics based on column name and content type some columns will already be selected.

Here's what these heuristics look like:

- **Title:**

  The column title contains `summary`, `title`, `description` or `content` and every row has a value.

- **Content:**

  There's at least one row that contains a new line

- **Owner:**

  The column title contains `creator`, `assignee` or `owner`.

- **Effort:**

  The content consists of numbers and the column title contains `estimate`, `effort`.

- **Priority:**

  The content consists of numbers or values that are reused at least once. And the column title contains `priority`.

- **Status:**

  The column title contains `status` or `state`.

<Aside>

Does your tool have an output that doesn't match these heuristics? Feel free to reach out to [hello@codecks.io](mailto:hello@codecks.io).

</Aside>

Once you've mapped the columns to the card properties you may have one of two choices, depending on what type of csv you're using:

### Importing new Cards

This option is availabl for any csv. You can define an output deck and export all your cards there.

There currently is no support to use a single csv to import into multiple decks.

### Re-Importing existing Cards

If you exported a csv from Codecks (By selecting cards and looking for the `Export cards` option), you notice that the csv also includes a `Card id` column. If this column is present and all rows contain a valid id, another option is shown: `Update cards`.

This allows to update the cards in place. One use case could be to change the effort of all cards by a factor of 2.

You'll export these cards and load them into a spreadsheet tool. There you can bulk update the contents to your liking.

You can then export the results as csv and re-import them using the CSV Importer.

## Trello Importer

This tool can be found towards the bottom of the Organzation Settings as well. The importer allows you to map most Trello properties to their Codecks counterparts:

<Aside>

- **Lists** ➡️ **Decks**
- **Cards** ➡️ **Cards**
- **Labels** ➡️ **[Project Tags](/tags/)**
- **Attachments** ➡️ **[Attachments](/attachments/)** (up to 500MB in total)
- **Card members** ➡️ **[Card Owner](/owner/)** (note that Codecks only supports at most one [Owner](/owner/) per card)
- **Checklists** ➡️ **[Checklist](/text-editor/#checklists) within the card content**
- **Due Dates** ➡️ **[Due Dates](/due-dates/)** (will be imported, but they'll only be usable in the Pro plan)

</Aside>

Most notably comments, any power-up content or the activity history won't be imported.

Once you start the flow, you'll be asked to give read-only access to your organizations. You may then pick the Board to be imported.

![Trello Importer](./images/import/trello-1.png)

You get a high-level overview of the project to be imported and can decide whether new decks will be created in an existing project or whether a new project should be created.

The next screen allows you to decide whether or not to import attachments and how the existing trello users should be mapped. If the users are not on Codecks yet, you might want to invite them first before starting the importer. Otherwise you'd have to manually assign the tasks once they are on Codecks.

## HacknPlan Importer

Just like the Trello Importer, this tool can be found towards the bottom of the Organzation Settings as well. The importer allows you to map most HacknPlan properties to their Codecks counterparts:

<Aside>

### Option 1: Boards as Decks

- **Boards** ➡️ **Decks** (Tasks without a board will end up in a "Backlog" Deck
- **Categories** ➡️ **Project Tags**
- **Milestones** ➡️ **Milestones**
- **Tags** ➡️ **Project Tags**

### Option 2: Categories as Decks

- **Categories** ➡️ **Decks**
- **Boards** (if they have a due date) ➡️ **Milestones**
- **Milestones** ➡️ **Milestones**
- **Tags** ➡️ **Project Tags**

### Shared for both options

- **Tasks** ➡️ **Cards**
- **Attachments** ➡️ **[Attachments](/attachments/)** (up to 500MB in total)
- **Assignees** ➡️ **[Card Owner](/owner/)** (note that Codecks only supports at most one [Owner](/owner/) per card)
- **Subtasks for Tasks** ➡️ **[Checklist](/text-editor/#checklists) within the card content**
- **Subtasks for User Stories** ➡️ **[Hero Cards](/hero-cards/) the order of the sub cards might be different due to API limitations**
- **Cover Image** ➡️ **Cover Image**
- **Importance Level** ➡️ **Priority** (You can define a mapping before importing)
- **Estimated cost** ➡️ **Effort** (You can define a scaling factor before importing)
- **Due Dates** ➡️ **[Due Dates](/due-dates/)** (will be imported, but they'll only be usable in the Pro plan)
- **Dependencies** ➡️ **[Dependencies](/dependencies/)** (will be imported, but they'll only be usable in the Pro plan)

</Aside>

Most notably comments, the start date and the work logs won't be imported.

To start the flow you first need to generate a read-only API key within the HacknPlan [Api Settings](https://app.hacknplan.com/settings?section=api).

To create an Api Key within the settings screen:

1. Click the "Create" Button.
2. Create an Api Key with a name like `Codecks`. It needs `Projects Read` and `Work Items Read` access.
3. Copy the Api key and paste it into the Codecks importer. The key won't be stored, so if you plan to import multiple times, make sure to store the Api key somewhere safe.

The next step allows to pick the HacknPlan project of your choice.
You may then decide whether to import the tasks into an existing project or a new one.

You'll then see an overview of the project to be imported and can make a few decsions:

![HacknPlan Importer](./images/import/hnp-1.png)

- **Deck Strategy:** as you can see in the box above, there's two options for how to import decks. They can either based on boards or on categories.
- **Import closed Tasks:** allows you to import closed tasks as archived Codecks cards.
- **Import closed Boards:** will consider closed boards when importing. The resulting decks or milestones (depending on the Deck Strategy) won't look different than non-closed boards.
- **Import attachments**
- **Effort scaling:** the effort is based on the `Estimated cost` within HacknPlan. This field allows to convert hours into an effort value. The value you enter corresponds to "effort points per hour".
- **Importance Level Mapping:** Pick how to map to the 4 Codecks priority options
- **User Mapping:** Pick which HacknPlan user corresponds to which Codecks user. If the users are not on Codecks yet, you might want to invite them first before starting the importer. Otherwise you'd have to manually assign the tasks once they are on Codecks.



# Discord

Codecks features the built-in Discord bot **Decky**. Beyond notifications and card manipulation commands Decky helps you with community management by allowing your users to vote on ideas and feedback. These ideas become cards that live inside Codecks and that can be scheduled and managed like any other card. As you work on these cards, you can let Decky automatically update your community on the state of their feedback.

Decky will keep your community engaged and save you a ton of time by letting your community help in prioritizing and managing the feedback that you receive.

<Aside>

In our opinion every Discord marketing strategy for game devs should involve Decky. See this [blog post for some quick examples for using Decky on your server](https://www.codecks.io/blog/2019/discord-for-game-developers/). You may also jump onto our own cozy Discord community server and see the bot in action by clicking [here](https://discord.com/invite/9dPXv6T).

</Aside>

<Youtube id="A41zSXg8jZQ" />

## Enabling Discord Integration

To add Decky to your server, go to the Discord section in your Organization Settings. To see the Organization Settings, open the Mission Control sidebar by clicking the joystick icon 🕹️ in the top left.

Click on _“Add Discord Server”_ to be redirected to your Discord account page. After logging in you can select any of your Discord servers and authorize our bot.

If you authorize multiple servers you’ll be able to switch between the server that you’re currently managing by using the selection box in the top right of the Discord integration settings screen. If you have already added a server, you may add additional servers by clicking the "+" sign next to the selection box.

## Slash Commands

![Slash commands in the Codecks UI](<./images/discord/1 Slash Commands.png>)

Slash commands are used by your Discord community to send feedback (e.g. features requests or bug reports) to you. They allow your community to create cards inside your project management tool, so you can convert feedback directly into actionable task cards that live in your project management along with your other tasks. Decky will update the user on the state of their card and will manage any follow-up questions that you might have for them.

<Aside>

Example slash commands:

> `/bug I can’t access the settings screen.`

> `/feedback The fire sword needs to be nerfed.`

</Aside>

### Keywords

Any chat message in the chosen channel that starts with a "/" followed by the command keyword will be recognized as a command for the bot. Messages which don’t start with a keyword are ignored by Decky, allowing community members to also have regular conversations in that channel.

The card content will consist of the chat message (excluding the initial command keyword), any files attached to it and any messages included in the discussion thread.

### Channels

Slash commands can be set to listen in all channels (meaning community members will be able to use them across the entire Discord server), or only in one specific channel. You can also choose a private channel, but you need to make sure that you set up the bot with the appropriate Discord permissions to be able to receive and send messages on that channel.

### Upvoting &amp; Threshold

![Set Reaction Threshold in the UI](<./images/discord/2 Upvote Reaction.png>)

If you set the threshold to zero, any time the command is triggered a card will be immediately created in your Codecks project. If you want messages to have to be vetted by your Discord community first, you can set a minimum number of required upvotes by your community. Only once enough Discord users have approved the message, it will create a card in your Codecks project.

<Aside>

This is a great way for letting your community help you in filtering out inappropriate or redundant messages immediately and prioritizing popular feature requests or bug reports. It drums up your Discord community engagement and saves you lots of time. 😎

</Aside>

Each feedback messages contains an upvote button with your reaction emoji below. You can customize this reaction emoji within the settings. The person who created the message will automatically upvote their entry. This is why the minimum threshold needs to be 2 if you set one up.

### Workflow State Updates

![Reached Upvote Threshold in the UI](<./images/discord/3 Reached Upvote Treshold.png>)

Decky allows your community to stay up to date with workflow changes of their feedback entries. There are two types of feedback: Annotations and Status Messages.

**Annotations** are embedded directly into the users feedback entry and also visible in leaderboards.

**Status Messages** are additional messages that can be send either within a feedback entry's thread or a channel of your choice.

Here's an overview over all available workflow state updates. You may enable Annotations and Status Messages in any combination you want within the settings.

- **Threshold reached**: When a card has been created due to reaching the threshold
- **Card seen (Pro)**: Triggered when a card has been opened the first time
- **Card assigned (Pro)**: Triggered when a card has been assigned the first time
- **Run (Pro)**: Triggered when a card has been put into a Run the first time
- **Milestone (Pro)**: Triggered when a card has been put into a milestone the first time
- **Hand (Pro)**: Triggered when a card has been put into someone's hand the first time
- **Card started**: Triggered when a card has been started the first time
- **Card done**: Triggered when a card has been marked as done the first time

Note that the order of these entries is meaningful. At most one Annotation is shown on a feedback entry, and it's always the one that is last in the order above. I.e. adding a card to the milestone and assigning in it to a user afterwards will still result in the milestone Annotation being shown as it has a higher priority.

Workflow state updates labeled with **Pro** are available only to organizations on the **Pro** plan.

<Adventure>

With a wicked crunch, the other ship crashes into yours. Soon, the Time Pirates are upon you. They dart to and fro. Many brave goblins fall in their assault. The Time Pirates are trying to reach the Card Witch. You hesitate. Is this really your fight? No goblin would notice if you [jumped overboard](/users/)! But you could stand your ground and [fight off the Time Pirates](/hero-cards/).

</Adventure>

### Community Cards in Codecks

![Cards created from the community](<./images/discord/4 Community Cards.png>)

Once a slash command has received enough upvotes a card with its content will be created in Codecks. These cards behave like regular cards in Codecks and have access to the full suite of workflows. For example you can assign them to a team member, assign priority or add them to a Run.

You can recognize the cards that were added by Decky through a potion icon. The icon will appear in the bottom row of the mini card or in the top right of any opened card. Hovering over the icon will show you the number of upvotes the card has received across all channels: Discord, Codecks (internal team upvotes) and on your public [Open Decks](/open-decks/) page. You may also use _‘upvoted’_ as criteria for sorting cards and to quickly identify the top reported community messages.

### Commenting on Cards

![Use Codecks to DM a user on Discord](<./images/discord/5 Commenting on Cards.png>)

You can send the feedback author a message without leaving Codecks. Opening a comment on a Discord-reported card, you’ll see the username and portrait of the user that reported the card, as if they were part of your team 🤯. Their portrait is also designated by a small Discord icon. You can also add them to the conversation by using the user handle `@discord`.

Once you submit the comment, the user will receive a direct message from Decky with the content of your comment. The user can respond to the message like any other DM. Their responses will directly show up inside the comment thread and you’ll receive a notification for the new comment thread content. This even works with Attachments.

You'll receive a warning message should the user not allow DMs by Decky.

<Aside>

This is a great way for collecting additional information from your Discord community and to ask follow-up questions. In case of a bug report you might have specific questions about the platform or repro steps or there might be something unclear about the feedback.

You won’t have to seek out the user manually on your Discord server or deal with extra friend requests and once you’ve collected all the required information any other team person can still look up all the conversation between your team and the user easily.

</Aside>

Users may also directly contact you. They can hit the ⚙️ button below a feedback entry. Given that the entry has a card associated with it and that the user has the configured role (by default everyone may use it), a "Add private Feedback" button shows up. This allows a user to enter a message which will create a new conversation on your card. Replying to this conversation in the card will send the user a DM just like above.

### Images

Decky can also handle images, either as part of the original report message, in the thread or via direct message, so your community can send you screenshots of bugs or helpful drawings. Their images will be attached to the card.

### Leaderboards

![Example Leaderboard as shown in Discord](<./images/discord/6 Leaderboards.png>)

Leaderboards are periodic overviews of the most popular requests received by Decky and posted to a channel of your choice. It lists the most upvoted entries for the specified period, with links to the original chat message.

You can customize the number of entries the leaderboard should contain and the text message that will appear on top. You can also specify on which days and at what time the leaderboard should be posted.

<Aside>

Leaderboards are a great way for your community to catch up on the hot trends in community feedback without having to scroll through lots of chat messages in your channel. By resurfacing the most reported entries, they also help with directing users to the existing entries in case there is already a message that they agree with or that they wanted to report themselves.

</Aside>

The leaderboard includes entries whether they have already reached the threshold or not, so they may also contain those that still need a couple more upvotes to make it into your Codecks project.

<Aside>

Enabling Decky also adds a `/leaderboard` slash command. This allows any user to generate a leaderboard for their specified time range. The leaderboard will be shared privately with the user, so it won't cause any noise in your channel.

</Aside>

### Karma

Submitting good or useful feedback will award users with Karma points and additional roles. Users gain 1 point for each upvote reaction to their feedback, and a configurable amount of points for each feedback that gets marked as "done" by the developer.

A user's karma is displayed next to the submitted feedback and can also be shown with `/karma` slash command. As a reward, server admins may auto-assign custom roles to contributors that reach a certain Karma threshold. Each slash command can define their own Karma value within the "Basic settings" when a report gets marked as done. By default this is set to 10.

This feature can be found in the Slash Commands section of the Discord Integration settings.

### Deactivating Feedback Entries

Once a card has passed the upvote threshold and has been created in Codecks, you can also use the regular archive and remove actions on it. Doing so will also prevent the card from showing up in future leaderboards.

Sometimes you might want to get rid of a feedback entry that hasn’t made it through the Decky threshold yet but is still appearing in the leaderboards or you might want to delete a card that made it through the threshold without leaving Discord.

For this you can use the ⚙️ button attached to the message. If you have the configured role (by default it's a role containing "Adminstrator" rights), you'll receive a reply containing a "Deactivate" button. Clicking it allows you to specify a reason and deactivates the message. The reason is shown below the original entry and upvotes are prevented.

### Conversation Threads

Every time feedback is submitted via a Slash Command, Decky creates a conversation thread on Discord. The contents of this thread can also be found in the Card on Codecks. You can click on the Discord logo there to jump into the thread.

Here's who gets automatically added to these threads:

- The community member who submitted the feedback.
- Any members reacting to the feedback via emoji.
- Optional: members with a specific server role. This is particularly useful for server moderators, so that they can be notified of any new message being posted. The setting for this can be found in the "Workflow state updates" section of a command.

## Project Notifications

![Project Notification Settings in the UI](<./images/discord/7 Project Notifications.png>)

Codecks features a powerful built-in notification system. You can also share some or all of these notifications in a Discord channel of your choice.

You can select one channel in which these notifications should appear. Make sure that you have given Decky a role that allows it to access the channel and to write to it. Select a project and the type of notifications that you want to have reported. You can select:

- New card created
- Card started
- Card marked as done
- Block or review started
- Comment thread started
- New comment in existing thread
- New milestone created
- Milestone updated

You can set up multiple project notifications at the same time and also choose to use the same channel for notifications from multiple projects.

## Removing the bot

To remove Decky from your server, go to Organization Settings in Codecks and select _“Remove Server”_ at the bottom of the Discord Integration window. If you have Decky running on multiple servers, make sure to first choose the correct server in the top right selection box. You might also want to remove Decky from the Discord Server Settings (under "Integrations"), but you should know this will make Decky very sad 😢!
